RESULTS: THE FOLLOWING 7 GENES WERE FOUND TO BE UPREGULATED BY GARLIC INTAKE: ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR), ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT), HYPOXIA-INDUCIBLE FACTOR 1ALPHA (HIF1A), PROTO-ONCOGENE C-JUN (JUN), NUCLEAR FACTOR OF ACTIVATED T CELLS (NFAT) ACTIVATING PROTEIN WITH IMMUNORECEPTOR TYROSINE-BASED ACTIVATION MOTIF 1 (NFAM1), ONCOSTATIN M (OSM), AND V-REL AVIAN RETICULOENDOTHELIOSIS VIRAL ONCOGENE HOMOLOG (REL).|||[26350169]INCREASING EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT AHR MIGHT COMPETE WITH AHR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT) FOR COMPLEX FORMATION WITH HYPOXIA-INDUCIBLE FACTOR-1Α (HIF-1Α) FOR TRANSACTIVATION, WHICH COULD ALTER SEVERAL PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIABLES.|||[26350169]INTERESTINGLY, NCOA2 OVEREXPRESSION DOWNREGULATED HRE TRANSACTIVATION BY COMPETING WITH HIF-1Α AND AHR TO FORM PROTEIN COMPLEXES WITH ARNT.|||[25942489]THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT Α-NF SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED TRIGLYCERIDE (TG) ACCUMULATION IN MATURE ADIPOCYTES, WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED EXPRESSION OF HORMONE-SENSITIVE LIPASE (HSL), ESTROGEN RECEPTOR (ER), AS WELL AS DECREASED EXPRESSION OF AHR, AHR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT), CYTOCHROME P4501B1 (CYP1B1), AND NUCLEAR FACTOR ERYTHROID-2-RELATED FACTOR (NRF-2) PROTEINS.|||[25522763]SIRNAS AGAINST NOT ONLY ARNT BUT ALSO ITS COUNTERPART ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) AND THEIR TARGET PROTEIN, CYP1A1, DRAMATICALLY ABROGATED NK150460'S GROWTH-INHIBITORY ACTIVITY.|||[25201625]FURTHERMORE, AHR-LIGANDS ALONE AT HIGH CONCENTRATIONS INDUCED A MODERATE CXCL8-RESPONSE, WITHOUT AFFECTING CCL5, BUT SUPPRESSED BOTH CXCL8 AND CCL5-RESPONSES BY POLY I:C. CONCLUSION: AHR AND ARNT MAY DIFFERENTIALLY AND INDEPENDENTLY REGULATE CHEMOKINE-RESPONSES INDUCED BY BOTH INHALED POLLUTANTS AND PULMONARY INFECTIONS.|||[25201625]CONSTITUTIVELY ACTIVE, UNLIGATED AHR SUPPRESSED THE ACTIVATION OF P65, WHILE ARNT MAY POSSIBLY INTERFERE WITH THE ACTION OF ACTIVATED P65.|||[24966027]UPON BINDING TO ITS LIGANDS, CYTOPLASMIC AHR TRANSLOCATES TO THE NUCLEUS, HETERODIMERIZES WITH ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT), AND MEDIATES NUMEROUS BIOLOGICAL AND TOXICOLOGICAL EFFECTS BY INDUCING THE TRANSCRIPTION OF VARIOUS AHR-RESPONSIVE GENES.|||[24565903]QRT-PCR WAS APPLIED TO ASSESS THE EXPRESSION OF AHR, AHRR (AHR REPRESSOR), ARNT (AHR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR) AS WELL AS AHR DEPENDENT GENES: CYP1A1 AND CYP1B1.|||[24565903]RESULTS: IN GENERAL, DIOXIN DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE THE EXPRESSION OF AHR AND ARNT, BUT REDUCED AHRR LEVEL.|||[24486526]WE GENERATED THREE N-TERMINAL DELETION CONSTRUCTS OF THE HUMAN AHR OF 12-24 KDA IN SIZE--NAMELY D1, D2, AND D3--TO SUPPRESS THE ARNT FUNCTION.|||[24486526]D2, WHICH CONTAINS PART OF THE AHR PAS-A DOMAIN AND INTERACTS WITH THE PAS-A DOMAIN OF ARNT, INHIBITS THE FORMATION OF THE AHR GEL SHIFT COMPLEX.|||[24486526]D2 SUPPRESSES THE RECRUITMENT OF ARNT TO THE CYP1A1 PROMOTER BUT NOT TO THE CYP1B1 PROMOTER, PARTLY BECAUSE THE AHR/ARNT HETERODIMER BINDS BETTER TO THE CYP1B1 DRE THAN TO THE CYP1A1 DRE.|||[24355420]ACTIVATION OF AHR RESPONSIVE GENES REQUIRES AHR DIMERIZATION WITH THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT), A HETERODIMERIC PARTNER ALSO SHARED BY THE HYPOXIA-INDUCIBLE FACTOR-1Α (HIF-1Α) PROTEIN.|||[24299737]ZINC FINGER NUCLEASE-MEDIATED KNOCKOUT OF AHR OR ARNT IN HUMAN BREAST CANCER CELLS ABOLISHES BASAL AND LIGAND-DEPENDENT REGULATION OF CYP1B1 AND DIFFERENTIALLY AFFECTS ESTROGEN RECEPTOR Α TRANSACTIVATION.|||[24299737]KNOCKOUT OF AHR OR ARNT PREVENTED THE 2,3,7,8-TETRACHLORODIBENZO-P-DIOXIN (TCDD)-DEPENDENT INDUCTION OF ALL AHR TARGET GENES EXAMINED.|||[24299737]KNOCKOUT OF AHR OR ARNT ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BASAL CYTOCHROME P4501B1 (CYP1B1) EXPRESSION LEVELS, WHICH WERE RESTORED WITH OVEREXPRESSION OF EITHER PROTEIN BUT NOT WITH A DNA BINDING-DEFICIENT AHR MUTANT.|||[24299737]BASAL AND TCDD-, 17Β-ESTRADIOL (E2)-, OR TCDD + E2-DEPENDENT RECRUITMENT OF AHR, ARNT, ERΑ, NCOA3, AND RNA POLYMERASE II TO CYP1B1 AS WELL AS CYP1B1 MRNA LEVELS WERE ABOLISHED IN MCF7-AHR((KO)) AND MDA-MB-231 AHR(KO) CELLS.|||[24299737]MOREOVER, THE TCDD-DEPENDENT INCREASES IN THE PROTEOLYTIC DEGRADATION OF ERΑ WERE PREVENTED BY THE LOSS OF AHR OR ARNT.|||[24091107]WE ALSO FOUND THAT DEXAMETHASONE STIMULATES BOTH LIGAND-DEPENDENT AND LIGAND-INDEPENDENT DEGRADATION OF AHR BUT NOT OF ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT) PROTEIN IN JEG-3 CELLS.|||[24081025]ARNT IS A HETERODIMERISATION PARTNER OF THE XENOBIOTIC LIGAND ACTIVATED ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR), THE SINGLE MINDED PROTEINS (SIM), THE CARDIOVASCULAR HELIX-LOOP-HELIX FACTOR 1 AND THE HYPOXIA INDUCIBLE FACTOR PROTEINS (HIF-ALPHA).|||[23831623]SINCE ARNT IS A COMMON DIMERIZATION PARTNER OF AHR AND HIF-1Α, WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT AHR MIGHT SUPPRESS LPA-INDUCED VEGF-A EXPRESSION IN PC-3 CELLS BY COMPETING WITH HIF-1Α FOR ARNT.|||[23768840]BLOOD SAMPLES WERE PROCESSED FOR GENOTYPING FOR THE SELECTED POLYMORPHISMS: AHR (RS2066853), AHR REPRESSOR (AHRR) (RS2292596), ARYL HYDROCARBON NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT) (RS2228099), AND CLOCK (RS1801260).|||[23733406]THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR), A LIGAND-ACTIVATED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR THAT

HYDROCARBONS (PAH).|||[23512538]LIGAND ACTIVATION LEADS TO AHR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATION AND BINDING TO A XENOBIOTIC RESPONSE ELEMENT (XRE) IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE ARNT TO REGULATE GENE EXPRESSION.|||[23477502]TCDD-BOUND AHR SUBSEQUENTLY TRANSLOCATES TO THE NUCLEUS AND INTERACTS WITH THE AHR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT) TO INDUCE SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION.|||[23477502]WE GENERATED CELLS THAT STABLY CO-EXPRESS RENILLA LUCIFERASE TAGGED-AHR (AHR-RL), AH RECEPTOR-INTERACTING PROTEIN (AIP), P23 AND YELLOW FLUORESCENT PROTEIN-TAGGED ARNT (ARNT-YFP) (AAPA CELLS) FOR DETECTION OF DIOXIN-LIKE COMPOUNDS.|||[23477502]TREATMENT WITH 3-METHYLCHOLANTHRENE (3MC), AHR AGONIST, ENHANCED THE INTERACTION BETWEEN AHR AND ARNT AND AVOIDED PROTEOSOMAL DEGRADATION.|||[23193992]WE GENERATED CELL LINES THAT STABLY CO-EXPRESS A FUSION PROTEIN OF AHR AND RENILLA LUCIFERASE (AHR-RL) AND EITHER HSP90 OR ARNT TAGGED WITH YELLOW FLUORESCENT PROTEIN (HSP90-YFP OR ARNT-YFP).|||[23193992]THE FLUORESCENT SIGNALS OF YFP ARE ACTIVATED BY THE EMISSION OF RL WHILE THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN AHR AND HSP90 (OR ARNT) WERE MONITORED.|||[23193992]APPLICATION OF 3-METHYLCHOLANTHRENE, THE AHR AGONIST, ENHANCES BRET SIGNALS IN CELLS CO-EXPRESSING AHR-RL, AIP-HIS, P23-HIS AND ARNT-YFP (AAPA CELLS), WHILE SUPPRESSING BRET SIGNALS IN CELLS CO-EXPRESSING AHR-RL, AIP-HIS, P23-HIS AND HSP90-YFP (AAPH CELLS).|||[22981438]THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT ALTHOUGH IT IS GENERALLY KNOWN THAT MANY AHR LIGANDS SUCH AS TCDD AND B(A)P FUNCTION MAINLY BY THE AHR/ARNT COMPLEX, LIGAND-SPECIFIC INTERACTION BETWEEN SDS3 AND ARNT EXERTS DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS ON THE EXPRESSION OF GENES ASSOCIATED WITH THYMOCYTE DIFFERENTIATION.|||[22952704]BACKGROUND: THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) REPRESSOR (AHRR), A MEMBER OF GROWING SUPERFAMILY, IS A BASIC-HELIX-LOOP-HELIX/PER-AHR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT)-SIM (BHLH-PAS) PROTEIN.|||[22235307]INTRIGUINGLY, KNOCKDOWN OF ARNT DOES NOT EFFECT TCDD-MEDIATED REPRESSION OF ESTROGEN-REGULATED TRANSCRIPTION, SUGGESTING THAT AHR REPRESSES ER FUNCTION INDEPENDENTLY OF ARNT.|||[22177959]IN CONCLUSION, ATRA AT PHYSIOLOGICAL CONCENTRATIONS COULD REDUCE AHR-MEDIATED GENE TRANSCRIPTION VIA THE INHIBITION OF RECRUITMENT OF ARNT TO RELEVANT DNA REGIONS.|||[22138065]BBP (1 ΜM) SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE MRNA AND PROTEIN LEVELS OF AHR, ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT) AND CYTOCHROME-P450 (CYP)1B1 IN HO23 CELLS.|||[22138065]BBP INDUCED THE AHR FUSION PROTEIN TO LOCALIZE AND ACCUMULATE AROUND THE NUCLEUS, AND AHR HETERODIMERIZATION WITH ARNT WAS OBSERVED IN THE NUCLEUS BY IMMUNOPRECIPITATION.|||[21828933]A KEY STEP IN THE ACTIVATION OF AHR INVOLVES HETERODIMERIZATION WITH THE AHR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT) PROTEIN BEFORE BINDING TO ITS DNA RESPONSE ELEMENT.|||[21828933]THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO IDENTIFY SNPS IN THE HUMAN ARNT GENE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY AFFECT THE SENSITIVITY OF AHR-DEPENDENT GENE TRANSCRIPTION.|||[21742528]RNA EXPRESSIONS OF AHR, ARNT AND CYP1B1 ARE INFLUENCED BY AHR ARG554LYS POLYMORPHISM.|||[21742528]AIM: THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) IS A LIGAND ACTIVATED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR THAT TOGETHER WITH ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT) CONTROLS THE EXPRESSION OF XENOBIOTIC METABOLISING ENZYMES (XME) SUCH AS CYP1B1.|||[21742528]CONCLUSION: OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE HOMOZYGOTE VARIANT GENOTYPE OF AHR LYS554LYS IS ASSOCIATED WITH A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AHR, ARNT AND CYP1B1 MRNA EXPRESSION.|||[21666223]MOREOVER, INDUCTION OF SUCH AHR TARGET GENES AS CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, UGT1A1, AND BREAST CANCER RESISTANCE PROTEIN (BCRP), AS WELL AS OF AHR, ARNT, AND ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR REPRESSOR (AHRR) GENES, AFTER EXPOSURE TO AHR LIGANDS HAVE NOT BEEN STUDIED IN HUMAN PLACENTAL TROPHOBLAST CULTURES.|||[21666223]IN THIS ARTICLE, WE SHOW THAT ONLY CYP1A1 MESSENGER RNA (MRNA), BUT NOT CYP1A2, CYP1B1, UGT1A1, BCRP, AHR, ARNT, AND AHRR MRNAS, IS SIGNIFICANTLY INDUCED IN HUMAN TERM PLACENTAL TROPHOBLAST CULTURES AFTER EXPOSURE TO PROTOTYPE AHR LIGANDS/ACTIVATORS 2,3,7,8-TETRACHLORODIBENZO-P-DIOXIN, 3-METHYLCHOLANTHRENE, OMEPRAZOLE, AND Β-NAPHTHOFLAVONE.|||[21666223]IN CONCLUSION, WE DESCRIBE EXPRESSION AND ONTOGENY OF AHR/AHR AND ARNT/ARNT AND SYSTEMATICALLY CHARACTERIZE INDUCTION OF MAJOR AHR TARGET GENES IN HUMAN PLACENTAL TROPHOBLAST FORMING THE PLACENTAL MATERNAL-FETAL MORPHOLOGICAL AND METABOLIC BARRIER.|||[21494593]INCREASED AHR STIMULATED ΑB-CRYSTALLIN EXPRESSION IN TRANSFECTION EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT) AND DECREASED AHR REDUCED ΑB-CRYSTALLIN EXPRESSION.|||[21081473]WE CONDUCTED A CASE-CONTROL STUDY OF COLORECTAL ADENOMA (914 CASES, 1185 CONTROLS) AND CRC (496 CASES, 607 CONTROLS) AMONG JAPANESE AMERICANS, EUROPEAN AMERICANS AND NATIVE HAWAIIANS TO INVESTIGATE THE ASSOCIATION OF GENETIC VARIATION IN THE PAH AND HAA BIOACTIVATION PATHWAY (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, AHR AND ARNT) IDENTIFIED THROUGH SEQUENCING WITH RISK OF COLORECTAL NEOPLASIA, AS WELL AS THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH SMOKING AND INTAKES OF RED MEAT AND HAAS.|||[21047992]DELETION AND MUTATION ASSAYS REVEALED THAT BASIC HELIX-LOOP-HELIX/PER-ARNT-SIM A DOMAINS OF CKAHRR, PARTICULARLY 217-402 AMINO ACID RESIDUES, ARE INDISPENSABLE FOR THE REPRESSION, BUT THE AHR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR SEQUESTRATION BY CKAHRR AND SUMOYLATION OF CKAHRR ARE NOT INVOLVED IN ITS REPRESSIVE MECHANISM.|||[20854796]PROMOTER ANALYSIS SUGGESTED THAT UGT1A6 INDUCTION BY METHOTREXATE COULD BE DRIVEN BY THE TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS ARNT (HIF-1) AND AHR/ARNT.|||[20478695]THIS LIGAND-DEPENDENT INDUCTION OF BLIMP1 REQUIRES THE EXPRESSION OF BOTH AHR AND ARNT, SINCE TRANSFECTION OF SIRNA SPECIFIC TO EITHER AHR OR ARNT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BLIMP1 MRNA IN RESPONSE TO MC.|||[20228066]BOTH QUANTITATIVE PCR AND IMMUNOBLOT ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT INDUCTION OF THE HYPOXIA RESPONSE PATHWAY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE LEVELS OF AHR DOWNSTREAM TARGETS CYP1A1 AND CYP1B1 AND AHR PROTEIN BINDING TO ARNT.|||[20006590]SF9 BETA-TUBULIN INTERACTS WITH ARNT AND SUPPRESSES THE BINDING OF THE AHR/ARNT HETERODIMER TO ITS CORRESPONDING ENHANCER.|||[20006590]HUMAN BETA4-TUBULIN, WHICH SHARES HIGH SEQUENCE IDENTITY WITH SF9 BETA-TUBULIN, SUPPRESSES THE AHR-DEPENDENT LUCIFERASE EXPRESSION BY REDUCING THE NUCLEAR ARNT CONTENT AND RETAINING ARNT IN THE CYTOPLASM.|||[19850893]WE SUGGEST THAT THE DOWN-REGULATION OF ARNT MAY BE CONNECTED TO AN IMBALANCE IN AHR/ARNT COMPLEX FORMATION ARISING FROM ABERRANT CAMP SIGNALING.|||[19815066]AHR BUT NOT ARNT ENHANCED THE AR-TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVITY WHICH WAS INDEPENDENT OF EXOGENOUS AHR LIGAND TREATMENT (2,3,7,8-TETRACHLORODIBENZO-P-DIOXIN, TCDD).|||[19778576]AHR AND ARNT MODULATE ER SIGNALING.|||[19778576]THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR), IN COMPLEX WITH ITS BINDING PARTNER ARNT, MEDIATES THE CELLULAR RESPONSE TO XENOBIOTIC COMPOUNDS SUCH AS THE ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANT DIOXIN.|||[19778576]IN PARTICULAR, THE EFFECTS OF AHR AGONISTS ON THE ESTROGEN SIGNALING PATHWAYS AND THE ROLE OF ARNT AS A MODULATOR OF ER ACTIVITY ARE DISCUSSED.|||[19380484]REPRESSION OF AHR BY AHRRDELTA8 WAS NOT RELIEVED BY OVEREXPRESSION OF ARNT OR AHR COACTIVATORS, SUGGESTING THAT COMPETITION FOR THESE COFACTORS IS NOT THE MECHANISM OF REPRESSION.|||[19376845]OUR STUDIES THUS INDICATE THAT RESVERATROL INHIBITS DIOXIN INDUCTION OF THE CYP1 FAMILY MEMBERS EITHER BY DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY INHIBITING THE RECRUITMENT OF THE TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS AHR AND ARNT TO THE XENOBIOTIC RESPONSE ELEMENTS OF THE CORRESPONDING GENES.|||[19255421]MOST OF THE EFFECTS OF DIOXIN ARE ATTRIBUTED TO ITS ACTIVATION OF THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR), A TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR THAT BINDS TO THE AH RECEPTOR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT) TO REGULATE THE TRANSCRIPTION OF NUMEROUS GENES, INCLUDING CYP1A1 AND CYP1B1.|||[19255421]WE SHOW THAT THIS ACCELERATION IS MEDIATED BY THE AHR; ALSO, THAT DIOXIN INCREASES THE EXPRESSION OF SEVERAL GENES KNOWN TO BE REGULATED BY ARNT, WHICH HAVE CRITICAL ROLES IN THE CORNIFICATION AND EPIDERMAL BARRIER FUNCTION OF THE SKIN.|||[19255421]IN THE CYP1A1 ENHANCER, EGFR ACTIVATION PREVENTS RECRUITMENT OF THE P300 COACTIVATOR, ALTHOUGH NOT AFFECTING THE BINDING OF THE AHR OR ARNT.|||[19251700]AHRR ACTS BY COMPETING WITH AHR FOR HETERODIMER FORMATION WITH THE AHR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT) AND PREVENTING THE AHR.ARNT COMPLEX FROM BINDING THE XENOBIOTIC-RESPONSIVE ELEMENTS.|||[19251700]AHRR, BUT NOT AHR, ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED THE SUMOYLATION OF ARNT.|||[19154183]WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY OBSERVED THAT HIF-1ALPHA COMPETES WITH THE AHR FOR INTERACTION WITH ARNT UNDER CONDITIONS WHEN BOTH CONDITIONALLY REGULATED FACTORS ARE ACTIVATED.|||[19113837]COIMMUNOPRECIPITATION STUDIES SHOWED THAT EGCG STABILIZES AN AHR COMPLEX THAT INCLUDES HSP90 AND XAP2 (HEPATITIS B VIRUS X-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 2), AND DECREASES THE ASSOCIATION OF ARYL HYDROCARBON NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT) WITH LIGAND-ACTIVATED AHR.|||[19018768]CURCUMIN ATTENUATES CYTOCHROME P450 INDUCTION IN RESPONSE TO 2,3,7,8-TETRACHLORODIBENZO-P-DIOXIN BY ROS-DEPENDENTLY DEGRADING AHR AND ARNT.|||[19018768]NOTABLY, THE NUCLEAR LEVELS OF ARYLHYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) AND AHR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT) WERE DECREASED BY CURCUMIN, BUT THOSE IN THE CYTOPLASM WERE NOT.|||[19018768]IT WAS ALSO FOUND THAT OXIDATIVE STRESS MEDIATED THE CURCUMIN-INDUCED DEGRADATIONS OF AHR AND ARNT.|||[18708059]CYCLOPHILIN-40 (CYP40) PROMOTES THE FORMATION OF THE GEL SHIFT COMPLEX THAT CONTAINS THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR), AHR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT) AND DIOXIN RESPONSE ELEMENT (DRE) USING BACULOVIRUS EXPRESSED PROTEINS.|||[18541696]FURTHERMORE, DESPITE NOT AFFECTING THE DIRECT ACTIVATION OF THE CYTOSOLIC AHR BY TCDD AND SUBSEQUENTLY TRANSFORMING IT TO A DNA-BINDING FORM, V(5+) INHIBITED THE NUCLEAR ACCUMULATION OF LIGANDED AHR AND SUBSEQUENT FORMATION OF THE AHR/ARYL HYDROCARBON NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT)/XENOBIOTIC RESPONSIVE ELEMENT (XRE) COMPLEX.|||[18359762]SINCE ARNT IS A COMMON DIMERIZATION PARTNER OF AHR AND HIF-1ALPHA, WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE AHR INHIBITS PROSTATE TUMOR FORMATION BY COMPETING WITH HIF-1ALPHA FOR ARNT, THEREBY LIMITING VEGF PRODUCTION.|||[18359762]PROSTATES FROM AHR(+/+), AHR(+/-) AND AHR(-/-) C57BL/6J TRAMP MICE WERE CULTURED IN THE PRESENCE OF GRADED CONCENTRATIONS OF VANADATE, AN INDUCER OF VEGF THROUGH THE HIF-1ALPHA-ARNT PATHWAY.|||[18096572]SINCE THE ANALYSIS OF ARNT2 FUNCTION AT THE PROTEIN LEVEL HAS BEEN LIMITED, ARNT2 FUNCTION IN ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR)-MEDIATED SIGNALING WAS EVALUATED AND COMPARED TO ARNT.|||[18096572]ARNT2 EXPRESSED IN HEPA-1 CELL CULTURE LINES WITH REDUCED ARNT PROTEIN RESULTED IN MINIMAL INDUCTION OF ENDOGENOUS CYP1A1 PROTEIN COMPARED TO CELLS EXPRESSING ARNT, AND MUTATION OF THE PUTATIVE PROLINE RESIDUE AT AMINO ACID 352 TO HISTIDINE FAILED TO PRODUCE AN ARNT2 THAT COULD FUNCTION IN AHR-MEDIATED SIGNALING.|||[18000031]THE AHR REPRESSOR (AHRR) INHIBITS AHR SIGNALING THROUGH A PROPOSED MECHANISM INVOLVING COMPETITION WITH AHR FOR DIMERIZATION WITH AHR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT) AND BINDING TO AHR-RESPONSIVE ENHANCER ELEMENTS (AHRES).|||[18000031]IN TRANSIENT TRANSFECTIONS IN WHICH AHR2-DEPENDENT TRANSACTIVATION WAS REPRESSED BY AHRR1 OR AHRR2, INCREASING ARNT EXPRESSION FAILED TO REVERSE THE REPRESSION, SUGGESTING THAT AHRR INHIBITION OF AHR SIGNALING DOES NOT OCCUR THROUGH SEQUESTRATION OF ARNT.|||[18000031]THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT REPRESSION OF AHR TRANSACTIVATION BY AHRR INVOLVES THE N-TERMINAL PORTION OF AHRR; DOES NOT INVOLVE COMPETITION FOR ARNT; AND DOES NOT REQUIRE BINDING TO AHRES, ALTHOUGH AHRE BINDING CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE REPRESSION.|||[17991765]THE BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF DIOXINS ARE MEDIATED BY THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) AND ITS DIMERIZATION PARTNER, THE AHR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT), AND INCLUDE INTERFERENCE WITH HORMONAL SIGNALING PATHWAYS LIKE THE RESPONSE TO ESTROGENS.|||[17991765]IN THIS STUDY, WE SHOW THAT RECRUITMENT OF ARNT TO AHR OR HYPOXIA-INDUCIBLE FACTOR-1ALPHA SIGNALING PATHWAYS AS WELL AS SMALL INTERFERING RNA-MEDIATED DOWN-REGULATION OF ARNT LEVELS LEAD TO A REDUCTION IN ER TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVITY.|||[17949687]THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR REPRESSOR (AHRR) HAS BEEN PROPOSED TO INHIBIT ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) ACTIVITY BY COMPETING WITH AHR FOR FORMING A HETERODIMER WITH AHR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT) AND SUBSEQUENTLY BINDING TO THE XENOBIOTIC RESPONSIVE ELEMENTS (XRE).|||[17599377]HYPOXIA-INDUCED LOSS OF AH-RESPONSIVENESS WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH INDUCTION OF HYPOXIA-INDUCIBLE FACTOR-1ALPHA OR OTHER FACTORS THAT SEQUESTER THE AHR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATION (ARNT) PROTEIN, AND OVEREXPRESSION OF ARNT UNDER HYPOXIA DID NOT RESTORE AH-RESPONSIVENESS.|||[17559847]OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE POLYMORPHISMS IN ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR), ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR REPRESSOR (AHRR), AND ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR NUCLEAR

PATHWAYS BY SEQUESTERING ARNT.|||[17012224]THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) IS A CYTOSOLIC RECEPTOR WHICH UPON ACTIVATION BY ITS AGONISTS, TRANSLOCATES INTO THE NUCLEUS AND FORMS A DIMER WITH ARNT (ARYL HYDROCARBON NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR).|||[16567799]IN RESPONSE TO ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) LIGANDS, CYTOPLASMIC AHR BECOMES ACTIVATED AND THEN TRANSLOCATES TO THE NUCLEUS WHERE IT FORMS A

(ARNT).|||[15383530]MOREOVER, REDUCTION OF COCOA MRNA LEVELS BY SMALL INTERFERING RNA INHIBITED THE TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATION BY AHR AND ARNT.|||[15144902]THE ENHANCER DID NOT SHOW ANY INDUCIBLE

HETERODIMERIZATION.|||[14672759]TO INVESTIGATE THE EXPRESSION OF ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR REPRESSOR (AHRR) AND RELATED MOLECULES IN VARIOUS TISSUES AND THE EFFECTS OF AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS (AHS) ON THEIR EXPRESSION, WE DEVELOPED A RELIABLE TECHNIQUE OF QUANTIFICATION OF HUMAN AHRR AS WELL AS ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR), AHR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT) AND CYTOCHROME P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) MRNA BY REAL-TIME TAQMAN PCR METHOD.|||[12944374]AHR (ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR), AHRR (AHR REPRESSOR), AND ARNT (AHR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR) ARE MEMBERS OF THE BHLH (BASIC-HELIX-LOOP-HELIX)-PAS (PER-AHR/ARNT-SIM HOMOLOGY SEQUENCE) TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR SUPERFAMILY.|||[12944374]IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE PREPARED HETERODIMERIC BHLH-PAS DOMAINS DERIVED FROM AHR AND ARNT, AND AHRR AND ARNT BY CO-EXPRESSING EACH PAIR IN E.

REGION OF AHR OR AHRR.|||[12944374]METHYLATION OF THE TWO CPG SITES IN THE XRE CORE SEQUENCE REDUCED THE BINDING AFFINITY TO HETERODIMERIC PROTEINS, WITH 5-METHYLCYTOSINE IN THE AHR RECOGNITION SITE

THAT ANI-7 MEDIATES ITS EFFECTS VIA THE ACTIVATION OF THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) PATHWAY AND THE SUBSEQUENT INDUCTION OF CYP1 METABOLISING MONOOXYGENASES.|||[29262847]AMONG THESE REGULATORY FACTORS, WE IDENTIFY AHR, THE ARYL HYDROCARBON-RECEPTOR WHICH CONTROLS A HEALTHY IMMUNE RESPONSE IN THE LUNG EPITHELIUM AND WHOSE REPRESSOR, AHRR, HAS RECENTLY BEEN IMPLICATED IN SMOKING-MEDIATED LUNG CANCER.|||[29262847]CONCLUSIONS: WE IDENTIFY TFS, SUCH AS AHR, WHICH BECOME INACTIVATED IN THE EARLIEST STAGES OF LUNG CANCER AND WHICH, UNLIKE AHRR HYPOMETHYLATION, ARE ALSO INACTIVATED IN LUNG

MRNA AND PROTEIN EXPRESSION OF AHR, CYP1A1, TGF-Β1, AND MCP-1 IN HK-2 CELLS.|||[29238104]FURTHERMORE, KNOCKDOWN OF STAT3 INHIBITED THE IS-INDUCED MRNA AND PROTEIN EXPRESSION OF AHR, CYP1A1, TGF-Β1,

OF THE TESTED STILBENES INCLUDING RESVERATROL CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY THE EXPRESSION OF AHR, ALTHOUGH CYP1A1 PROTEIN LEVEL WAS SLIGHTLY REDUCED IN MDA-MB-231 CELLS, WHILE CYP1B1 EXPRESSION WAS INCREASED IN THESE CELLS AS A RESULT OF TREATMENT WITH 3MS, BUT ONLY AT THE TRANSCRIPT LEVEL.|||[29143794]AMONG PROTOBERBERINES AT NON-CYTOTOXIC CONCENTRATIONS (≤10 ΜM), BERBERINE HAD THE MOST POTENT AND

IN HUMAN MONOCYTES AND MACROPHAGES.|||[28973660]WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY SHOWN THAT CYP1A1 WAS HIGHLY INDUCED FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME IN A PATIENT WHO HAD BEEN POISONED BY 2,3,7,8-TETRACHLORODIBENZO-P-DIOXIN (TCDD), A COMPOUND KNOWN TO ACTIVATE THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR).|||[28973660]WHEN APPLYING TCDD AND BETA-NAPHTHOFLAVONE (BNF), ANOTHER AHR AGONIST, ON THE

HUMAN CELLS FROM B[A]P TOXICITY AND COMPLETELY REVERSED CISPLATIN RESISTANCE IN HUMAN CELLS THAT OVEREXPRESS CYP1B1 BY RESTORING CISPLATIN'S CYTOTOXICITY.|||[28710019]TO EXPLORE THE MECHANISM OF THE EFFECTS OF PAH MIXTURES ON NONLUTEINIZED GRANULOSA CELLS (HGRC1) AND GRANULOSA TUMOR CELLS (COV434), AS WELL AS CELL PROLIFERATION AND APOPTOSIS, WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECT OF PAH MIXTURES ON THE EXPRESSION OF THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR), ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT) AND ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR REPRESSOR (AHRR) GENES, AS WELL AS THE EXPRESSION AND ACTIVITY OF

DOWN-REGULATED AHRR, AND HAD NO EFFECT ON CYP1A1 AND COMT EXPRESSION, BUT DECREASED COMT ACTIVITY.|||[28710019]WE HYPOTHESISE THAT, DEPENDENT ON COMPOSITION, MIXTURES OF PAHS ACTIVATE THE AHR DIFFERENTLY THROUGH VARYING TRANSCRIPTION RESPONSES: IN HGRC1, A CANONICAL AHR MECHANISM OF M1, WITH ACTIVATION OF CYP1A1 IMPORTANT FOR DETOXICATION, WHILE IN COV434, A NONCANONICAL AHR MECHANISM, PROBABLY BY ACTIVATION THE NUCLEAR FACTOR NFKB.|||[28699004]THE RESPONSE WAS FOUND TO BE DEPENDENT ON ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) ACTIVATION, ALTHOUGH INDUCTION OF THE RESPONSE WAS DELAYED

OF AHR ARE UNCLEAR.|||[28681081]OVERALL, THIS STUDY REVEALS THAT AHR AND AHRR EXHIBIT SIMILAR BUT ALSO DISTINCT GENOME-WIDE BINDING PROFILES, SUPPORTING THE NOTION THAT AHRR IS A CONTEXT- AND GENE-SPECIFIC REPRESSOR OF AHR ACTIVITY.|||[28621325]ACTIVATION AND FUNCTIONALITY OF AHR WAS CONFIRMED THROUGH NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATION DETERMINED BY IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY AND REAL-TIME

DEPENDENT EXPRESSION OF CYP1 FAMILY VIA THE INTERACTION BETWEEN ESTROGEN RECEPTOR (ER) AND AHR.|||[28618207]THE INCREASED EXPRESSION OF AHR AND CYP1A1 INDUCED BY E2 WAS RESTORED TO THE CONTROL LEVEL BY THE CO-TREATMENT OF ICI 182,780, INDICATING THAT E2 INDUCED THE PROTEIN EXPRESSION LEVELS OF AHR AND CYP1A1 LIKE TCDD VIA AN ER DEPENDENT PATHWAY.|||[28618207]TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT E2 MAY PROMOTE AHR DEPENDENT EXPRESSION OF CYP1A1 VIA ER DEPENDENT PATHWAY IN MCF-7 CV CELLS EXPRESSING ER IN THE ABSENCE OF TCDD, AN AGONIST OF AHR.|||[28593539]THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR)-REPRESSOR (AHRR) IS A REGULATOR OF THE AHR PATHWAY, WHICH PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN XENOBIOTIC AND REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS) METABOLISM.|||[28498411]MITOCHONDRIAL ACTIVITY AND OXIDATIVE

AND TRANS-PINOSTILBENE.|||[28276465]WE DESCRIBE A FEEDBACK LOOP YET UNKNOWN IN HUMAN IMMUNE CELLS WHERE CYP1 INHIBITION RESULTED IN AN ALTERED AHR-DEPENDENT IMMUNE RESPONSE.|||[28254546]WHILE THERE WAS NO ALTERATION IN NRF2 EXPRESSION OR LOCALIZATION BETWEEN RELB(-/-) AND WILD TYPE CELLS IN RESPONSE TO CSE, RELB(-/-) CELLS DISPLAYED SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED AHR MRNA AND PROTEIN EXPRESSION, CONCOMITANT WITH LOSS OF AHR TARGET GENE EXPRESSION (CYP1A1, CYP1B1, NQO1).|||[28171546]A CAUSAL LINK BETWEEN OVEREXPRESSION OF ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) AND ITS TARGET CYTOCHROME P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) AND METASTATIC OUTGROWTH OF VARIOUS CANCER ENTITIES HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED.|||[28171546]THIS WAS ENFORCED BY THE ACTIVATING AHR LIGAND 6-FORMYLINDOLO (3,3-B)CARBAZOLE (FICZ), OR INHIBITED BY THE AHR ANTAGONIST 3,3'-DIINDOLYLMETHANE (DIM) AS WELL AS BY SIRNA AGAINST AHR AND CYP1A1.|||[28171546]AHR AND NF-KAPPAB WERE NEGATIVELY CROSS TALKING AND THEREFORE, THE INHIBITION OF AHR (BUT NOT CYP1A1) INDUCED RELA, RELB, NFKB1, NFKB2 AND THE NF-KAPPAB TARGET MMP1, WHICH ITSELF PROMOTES TUMOUR INTRAVASATION BY A MECHANISM THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM 12(S)-HETE.|||[28171546]CONVERSELY, THE INHIBITION OF NFKB2 INDUCED AHR, CYP1A1 AND 12(S)-HETE SYNTHESIS.|||[28103884]MECHANISTICALLY, INDUCTION OF AHR/CYP1A1 BY TCDD AND DMBA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN Β-CATENIN MRNA AND PROTEIN EXPRESSION, NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATION AND ITS DOWNSTREAM TARGET CYCLIN D1, WHEREAS AHR OR CYP1A1 KNOCKDOWN USING SHRNA DRAMATICALLY INHIBITED Β-CATENIN CELLULAR CONTENT AND NUCLEAR

(CYP1A1).|||[27853106]WHILE IT HAS LONG BEEN BELIEVED THAT BENZENES AND NAPHTHALENES ARE UNABLE TO ACTIVATE THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) BECAUSE THEY ARE POOR LIGANDS, WE RECENTLY REPORTED THAT THESE QUINOID METABOLITES UPREGULATED CYTOCHROME P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) IN HEPA1C1C7 CELLS (ABIKO ET AL., 2015).|||[27801952]MOREOVER, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT AΑC IS A POTENT INDUCER OF CYP1A1 AND CYP1B1

UPREGULATES CYP1A1, CYP1A2 AND CYP1B1 IN MANY MAMMALIAN ORGANS.|||[27312872]TCDD TREATMENT INCREASED CYP1A1 MRNA AND PROTEIN LEVELS, WHICH INDICATED THE ACTIVATION OF AHR SIGNALING.|||[27286660]CARBENDAZIM-INDUCED CYP1A1 EXPRESSION WAS BLOCKED BY AHR ANTAGONISTS, AND WAS ABOLISHED IN AHR SIGNAL-DEFICIENT CELLS.|||[27286660]RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT CARBENDAZIM

INDUCIBLE GENES (CYP1A1, AND CYP1B1) THAN WATER EXTRACTS (P<0.05).|||[26984638]THE DATA DEMONSTRATE THAT (1) ALDH(HIGH) CELLS EXPRESS ELEVATED LEVELS OF AHR AND CYP1B1 AND CYP1A1, AHR-DRIVEN GENES, (2) AHR KNOCKDOWN REDUCES ALDH ACTIVITY BY 80%, (3) AHR HYPER-ACTIVATION WITH SEVERAL LIGANDS, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL LIGANDS, SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES ALDH1 ACTIVITY, EXPRESSION OF STEM CELL- AND

TRANSCRIPTION OF SIX AHR TARGET GENES (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, UGT1A1, NQO1, AND AHRR) IN DIFFERENT PATTERNS IN HEP3B CELLS, WHEREAS THE AHR ANTAGONIST CH-223191 SUPPRESSED ALL THESE TARGET GENES SIMILARLY.|||[26715507]IN HUMAN UACC-3199 CELLS, LOW BRCA-1 WAS PARALLELED BY CONSTITUTIVE HIGH AHR EXPRESSION; THE TREATMENT WITH ΑNF RESCUED BRCA-1 AND ERΑ, WHILE ENHANCING PREFERENTIAL EXPRESSION OF CYP1A1 COMPARED TO CYP1B1.|||[26666021]THE EXPRESSION OF CYP1AL PROTEIN WAS INCREASED AFTER DIOSCIN TREATMENT, AND RESVERATROL, AN AHR ANTAGONIST, COULD DOWNREGULATE THE EXPRESSION OF CYP1A1.|||[26643992]KNOCKDOWN OF AHR IN SPHEROIDS SUPPRESSED CYP1A1 EXPRESSION; HOWEVER, CYP1A2 EXPRESSION LEVELS REMAINED UNCHANGED.|||[26630500]HUMAN HEPATOMA (HEPG2) CELL LINES WERE EXPOSED TO A WIDE RANGE OF PB CONCENTRATIONS VARYING FROM PHYSIOLOGICAL TO TOXIC LEVELS (0 TO 10 MG/L) FOR 24 H.

AHR REGULATION PATHWAY.|||[26601943]THE ADAR1 KNOCKDOWN ENHANCED THE LIGAND-MEDIATED INDUCTION OF CYP1A1, A GENE DOWNSTREAM OF AHR.|||[26593447]IN THIS STUDY, WE FOUND THAT PLACENTAL AHR PROTEIN LEVELS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AND PLACENTAL CYP1A1 MRNA LEVELS WERE HIGHER IN UNEXPLAINED RSA (URSA) PATIENTS THAN IN CONTROL SUBJECTS.|||[26593447]MOREOVER, OVEREXPRESSING AHR IN JAR CELLS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED CYP1A1 MRNA LEVELS AND INHIBITED CELL MIGRATION.|||[26567990]NONETHELESS, TREATMENT OF PARENTAL AS WELL AS DIFFERENTIATED SH-SY5Y CELLS WITH TCDD RESULTED IN THE INDUCTION OF AHR-REGULATED GENES, CYP1A1 AND CYP1B1; AHRR EXPRESSION WAS ALSO AFFECTED, BUT TO A MUCH SMALLER EXTENT.|||[26558458]ALL THE SUPERNATANT SAMPLES TESTED INDUCED AHR-DEPENDENT REPORTER GENE ACTIVITY AND

CURRENT DATA ON CYP1A1 EXPRESSION IN THE SKIN OF 67 PATIENTS WITH PROVEN EXPOSURE TO AHR AGONISTS, THESE DATA INDICATE A HIGH INCIDENCE OF AHR ACTIVATION IN THIS SERIES.|||[26405201]PKM2 CONTRIBUTES TO ENHANCEMENT OF TRANSCRIPTION OF CYTOCHROME P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), AN AHR-TARGET GENE, ACETYLATION AT LYSINE 9 OF HISTONE H3 AT THE CYP1A1 ENHANCER.|||[26363502]IN THE CURRENT PAPER WE DEMONSTRATE THAT IMPURITIES CONTAINED IN KETOCONAZOLE PREPARATIONS ARE STRONG ACTIVATORS OF HUMAN AHR AND INDUCERS OF CYP1A1.|||[26307030]INTRIGUINGLY, CIGARETTE SMOKING IS MOST STRONGLY AND ROBUSTLY ASSOCIATED WITH DNA MODIFICATIONS TO AN AHR PATHWAY GENE, THE AHR REPRESSOR (AHRR).|||[26252179]AHRR SERVES NOT ONLY TO INHIBIT ARYL-HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) TRANSCRIPTION, WHICH IS INVOLVED IN MEDIATING XENOBIOTIC

ROLES.|||[26160521]HOWEVER, THE HALOGENATED AROMATIC HYDROCARBON (HAH)-SELECTIVE AHR ANTAGONIST CH223191 CAUSED A CONSIDERABLE REDUCTION IN DEP-INDUCED CYP1A1 EXPRESSION INDICATING THAT THIS RESPONSE MAY BE DUE TO DIOXIN OR DIOXIN-LIKE CONSTITUENTS IN DEP.|||[25956473]DOCOSAHEXAENOIC ACID DOWN-REGULATED CYP1A1 AND UP-REGULATED THE AHR AND PTGS2 GENES.|||[25934798]CYTOCHROME P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), FOR EXAMPLE, IS RESTRICTED TO THE PERICENTRAL REGION OF LIVER LOBULES IN RESPONSE TO THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) AND WNT/Β-CATENIN SIGNALING PATHWAYS.|||[25934798]WITH THE HELP OF 29 MUTANT CONSTRUCTS OF THE HUMAN CYP1A1 PROMOTER AND A MATHEMATICAL MODEL THAT COMBINES WNT/Β-CATENIN AND AHR SIGNALING WITH THE STATISTICAL MECHANICS OF THE PROMOTER, WE SYSTEMATICALLY QUANTIFIED THE REGULATORY INFLUENCE OF DIFFERENT TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR BINDING SITES ON GENE INDUCTION WITHIN THE PROMOTER.|||[25873348]HOWEVER, EXPANSION OF THE END POINTS TO OTHER AH-RESPONSIVE GENES INCLUDING THE CYP1B1, THE AHR REPRESSOR (AHRR), AND 2,3,7,8-TETRACHLORODIBENZO-P-DIOXIN (TCDD)-INDUCIBLE POLY(ADP-RIBOSE) POLYMERASE (TIPARP) REVEALED A HIGHLY COMPLEX PATTERN OF AHR AGONIST/ANTAGONIST ACTIVITIES THAT WERE BOTH LIGAND- AND GENE-DEPENDENT.|||[25860963]THE TH17 TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS RORA AND RORC WERE DOWN REGULATED, WHEREAS AHR TARGET GENE CYP1A1 WAS UPREGULATED.|||[25831079]INTERESTINGLY, LOSS OF AHR WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A SIGNIFICANTLY ATTENUATED CYP1A1, NQO1, SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE 1(SOD1), AND NUCLEAR RELB PROTEIN EXPRESSION.|||[25826687]IT WAS ALSO OBSERVED IN QM-PDA CELLS THAT TCDD, OMEPRAZOLE, AND TRANILAST DID NOT INDUCE CYP1A1 OR CXCR4 AND THAT TREATMENT WITH THESE COMPOUNDS DID NOT RESULT IN NUCLEAR UPTAKE OF AHR.|||[25786502]METHODS: THE ACTIVATION (CYTOPLASMIC TO NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATION) OF AHR WAS CONFIRMED BY IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE STUDY AND BY UPREGULATION OF AN AHR-SPECIFIC MARKER, CYTOCHROME P450-1A1 (CYP1A1).|||[25786502]RESULTS: GFF INDUCED THE NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATION OF AHR WITH SIGNIFICANT AND DOSE-DEPENDENT UPREGULATION OF CYP1A1, FLG AND LOR GENE EXPRESSION.|||[25697376]MECHANISTICALLY, THE INVOLVEMENTS OF AHR AND NUCLEAR FACTOR ERYTHROID 2-RELATED FACTOR-2 (NRF2) IN THE MET-MEDIATED INHIBITION OF DMBA-INDUCED CYP1A1 AND NQO1 GENE EXPRESSION WERE EVIDENCED BY THE ABILITY OF MET TO INHIBIT DMBA-INDUCED XENOBIOTIC RESPONSIVE ELEMENT AND ANTIOXIDANT RESPONSIVE ELEMENT LUCIFERASE REPORTER GENE EXPRESSION WHICH SUGGESTS AN AHR- AND NRF2-DEPENDENT TRANSCRIPTIONAL CONTROL.|||[25697376]IN CONCLUSION, THE PRESENT WORK SHOWS A STRONG EVIDENCE THAT MET INHIBITS THE DMBA-MEDIATED CARCINOGENICITY AND ADDUCT FORMATION BY INHIBITING THE EXPRESSION OF CYP1A1 THROUGH AN AHR LIGAND-INDEPENDENT MECHANISM.|||[25668756]TREATMENTS OF HACAT HUMAN KERATINOCYTES WITH 4-CLBQ AND DIOXIN-LIKE PCB126 SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED AHR-TARGET GENE EXPRESSION, CYP1A1 MRNA AND PROTEIN LEVELS.|||[25668756]4-CLBQ-INDUCED INCREASE CYP1A1 EXPRESSION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE IN THE NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATION OF AHR PROTEIN AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN THE LUCIFERASE-REPORTER ACTIVITY OF A HUMAN CYP1A1 XENOBIOTIC RESPONSE ELEMENT (XRE).|||[25668756]6,2',4'-TRIMETHOXYFLAVONE (TMF), A WELL-CHARACTERIZED AHR-LIGAND ANTAGONIST SIGNIFICANTLY SUPPRESSED PCB126-INDUCED INCREASE IN CYP1A1 EXPRESSION, WHILE THE SAME TREATMENT DID NOT SUPPRESS 4-CLBQ-INDUCED INCREASE IN CYP1A1 EXPRESSION.|||[25668756]HOWEVER, SIRNA-MEDIATED DOWN-REGULATION OF AHR SIGNIFICANTLY INHIBITED 4-CLBQ-INDUCED INCREASE IN CYP1A1 EXPRESSION, SUGGESTING THAT AHR MEDIATES 4-CLBQ-INDUCED INCREASE IN CYP1A1 EXPRESSION.|||[25637755]TREATMENT OF BOTH CELL TYPES WITH 2,3,7,8-TETRACHLORODIBENZO-P-DIOXIN (TCDD)

DRAMATICALLY ABROGATED NK150460'S GROWTH-INHIBITORY ACTIVITY.|||[25482884]THE AHR LIGATION BY GLY WAS BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE, WITH SIGNIFICANT AND DOSE-DEPENDENT UPREGULATION OF CYP1A1 EXPRESSION, WHICH IS A SPECIFIC MARKER FOR AHR ACTIVATION.|||[25448748]IN BREAST CANCERS EXPRESSING ESTROGEN RECEPTORS (ERS), LEVEL OF CYP1B1 IS INCREASED BY E2 AND REVERSED BY AN ESTROGEN RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST, ICI 182,780 OR 4-HYDROTAMOXIFEN, WHICH INDICATES THAT THE EXPRESSION OF CYP1 FAMILY IN DOWNSTREAM REGION OF AHR IS REGULATED BY AN ACTIVATION OF ERΑ.|||[25448748]CYP1A1 EXHIBITS HYDROXYLASE ACTIVITY IN OXIDATION OF ARACHIDONIC ACID, WHICH HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED TO 12(R)-HYDRXYEICOSATETRAENOIC (HETES), A POTENT ACTIVATOR OF AHR ACTIVITY.|||[25404385]AT 10 NM, TCDD TIME-DEPENDENTLY DECREASED AHR PROTEIN LEVELS, WHILE IT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED CYP1A1 AND CYP1B1 MRNA LEVELS IN SKOV-3, OVCAR-3 AND IOSE-385 CELLS, INDICATING ACTIVATION OF AHR SIGNALING.|||[25398514]CYP1A1 IS INDUCIBLE VIA THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR), BUT WE DID NOT FIND THAT EXPRESSION OF AHR WAS DEPENDENT ON P53; RATHER, WE FOUND THAT BAP-INDUCED CYP1A1 EXPRESSION WAS REGULATED THROUGH P53 BINDING TO A P53 RESPONSE ELEMENT IN THE CYP1A1 PROMOTER REGION, THEREBY ENHANCING ITS TRANSCRIPTION.|||[25383696]OF THE NUMEROUS AHR LIGANDS, IT IS WELL-KNOWN THAT THOSE CONSIDERED NONTOXIC ARE QUICKLY METABOLIZED BY ENZYMES SUCH AS CYP1A1, WHICH DESTROYS THEIR ABILITY TO FUNCTION AS LIGANDS.|||[25327972]THEN, WE OBSERVED THAT A 6 H EXPOSURE TO 25 NM 2,3,7,8-TETRACHLORODIBENZO-P-DIOXIN, A STRONG AHR LIGAND, UP-REGULATED CYP1A1 AND CYP1B1 EXPRESSION, AND THAT THIS EFFECT WAS AHR DEPENDENT.|||[25327972]WHILE HYPOXIA DECREASED THE EXPRESSION OF THE TWO AHR TARGET GENES CYP1A1 AND CYP1B1, AHR ACTIVATION RESULTS IN NO CHANGE IN HYPOXIA TARGET GENE EXPRESSION.|||[25316167]IMPORTANTLY, WHEN THE CELLS WERE EXPOSED TO DDE AND PCB 153 IN THE PRESENCE OF AN ANTAGONIST OF TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR (TNF)-Α, THE OVER-EXPRESSION OF AHR WAS ABOLISHED; AS EXPECTED, THE EXPRESSION OF CYP1A1 WAS UNAFFECTED.|||[25257533]MOST DIOXIN-LIKE POLLUTANTS ACTIVATE THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR, WHICH REGULATES XENOBIOTIC METABOLISM ENZYMES THAT BELONG TO THE CYTOCHROME P450 1A FAMILY (THAT INCLUDES CYP1A1 AND CYP1B1).|||[25257533]HERE, WE FOCUS ON RECENT ADVANCES IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF MOLECULAR MECHANISMS THAT MEDIATE THIS CROSSTALK REPRESSION, AND PARTICULARLY ON HOW ERΑ REPRESSES THE AHR TARGET GENE CYP1A1, AND COULD SUBSEQUENTLY PROMOTE BREAST CANCER.|||[25233012]INHIBITION OF CYP1A1 MRNA INDUCTION BY THE AHR INHIBITOR CH223191 INDICATED AHR RECEPTOR DEPENDENCE THIS EFFECT.|||[25224404]IN AGREEMENT WITH PREVIOUS STUDIES, WE FOUND THAT CERTAIN AAS ACTIVATED THE AHR IN HUMAN LIVER AND LUNG CELLS AS ASSESSED BY AN INCREASE IN CYTOCHROME P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) EXPRESSION AND ACTIVITY.|||[25224404]WHEREAS 2-NAPHTHYLAMINE SIGNIFICANTLY ACTIVATED THE AHR AND INDUCED CYP1A1 EXPRESSION, ITS N-ACETYLATED METABOLITE WAS LESS EFFICIENT.|||[25218365]IN THIS STUDY THE EFFECT OF ADMINISTRATION OF Β-NAPHTHOFLAVONE (BNF), POTENT AHR LIGAND, ON THE EXPRESSION OF AHR, AHRR, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, NQO1, GSTA1, ALDH3A1 AND UGT1A GENES ENCODING THE ENZYMES CONTROLLED BY AHR WERE EXAMINED IN THIRTEEN LARYNGEAL TUMOR CELL LINES AND IN HEPARG CELL LINE.|||[25137396]IMMUNOPRECIPITATIONS SHOWED THAT WS BLOCKED THE INTERACTION OF ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) WITH AHR NUCLEAR TRANSPORTER TO REDUCE EXPRESSION OF COX-2 AND MPGES-1 BY INCREASING EXPRESSION OF AHR REPRESSOR (AHRR).|||[25137396]COLLECTIVELY, THESE STUDIES SHOW THAT EXPOSURE TO LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF WS ENHANCED CS-INDUCED INFLAMMATION BY INDUCING AHRR EXPRESSION TO SUPPRESS AHR, COX-2, AND MPGES-1 EXPRESSION, AND LEVELS OF PGE2 AND LIPOXIN A4.|||[25116688]3,3',4,4',5-PENTA CHLOROBIPHENYL (PCB 126) IS A POTENT LIGAND FOR AHR AND CAN THUS INDUCE THE EXPRESSION OF CYP1A1.|||[25110054]DOWN-REGULATION OF AHR EXPRESSION WAS REQUIRED FOR METFORMIN-MEDIATED DECREASES IN CYP1A1 AND CYP1B1 EXPRESSION, AND THE METFORMIN-MEDIATED CYP1A1 AND CYP1B1 REDUCTION IS IRRELEVANT TO ESTROGEN RECEPTOR Α (ERΑ) SIGNALING.|||[25110054]METFORMIN INHIBITED ENDOGENOUS AHR LIGAND-INDUCED CYP1A1 AND CYP1B1 EXPRESSION BY SUPPRESSING TRYPTOPHAN-2,3-DIOXYGENASE (TDO) EXPRESSION IN MCF-7 CELLS.|||[25110054]OUR FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE THAT METFORMIN REDUCES CYP1A1 AND CYP1B1 EXPRESSION IN BREAST CANCER CELLS BY DOWN-REGULATING AHR SIGNALING.|||[25084496]WE ANALYSED WHETHER GENE-ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN POLYMORPHISMS IN AHR (R554K) AND AHR

PARAMETERS OF MALE REPRODUCTIVE FUNCTION IN 581 PROVEN-FERTILE EUROPEAN AND GREENLANDIC MEN.|||[25075865]PHENOTYPE REFINEMENT STRENGTHENS THE ASSOCIATION OF AHR AND CYP1A1 GENOTYPE WITH CAFFEINE CONSUMPTION.|||[24885022]FURTHER, WE PRESENTED EVIDENCE SUGGESTING THAT NEITHER ENDOGENOUS AHR EXPRESSION LEVELS NOR DOWNSTREAM INDUCTION OF AHR TARGET GENES CYP1A1 AND CYP1B1 IS REQUIRED FOR AF-MEDIATED GROWTH INHIBITION IN THESE CELLS.|||[24837423]THE HYPOTHESIS OF A SYSTEM IS SUPPORTED BY (I) COORDINATE REGULATION OF SUBSETS OF THESE ENZYME FAMILIES AND TRANSPORTERS BY TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS INCLUDING THE AHR, AND (II) FEEDBACK LOOPS BETWEEN ENDOBIOTIC AHR AGONISTS AND SUBSTRATES OF MAJOR CATABOLIC TARGET GENES/PROTEINS; FOR EXAMPLE, 6-FORMYLINDOLO[3,2-B]CARBAZOLE AS SUBSTRATE OF CYP1A1, AND BILIRUBIN, AS SUBSTRATE OF UGT1A1.|||[24806346]THE AHR REPRESSOR (AHRR) IS AN AHR TARGET GENE AND FUNCTIONS AS A LIGAND-INDUCED REPRESSOR OF AHR; HOWEVER, ITS MECHANISM OF INHIBITION IS CONTROVERSIAL.|||[24806346]HERE WE COMPARED THE ABILITY OF AHRR- AND TIPARP-MEDIATED INHIBITION OF AHR ACTIVITY.|||[24806346]KNOCKDOWN OF TIPARP, BUT NOT AHRR, INCREASED TCDD-INDUCED CYP1A1 MRNA AND AHR PROTEIN LEVELS.|||[24806346]SIMILARLY, IMMORTALIZED TIPARP(-/-) MOUSE EMBRYONIC FIBROBLASTS (MEFS) AND AHRR(-/-) MEFS EXHIBITED ENHANCED AHR TRANSACTIVATION.|||[24806346]HOWEVER, UNLIKE TIPARP(-/-) MEFS, AHRR(-/-) MEFS DID NOT EXHIBIT INCREASED AHR PROTEIN LEVELS.|||[24806346]OVEREXPRESSION OF TIPARP IN AHRR(-/-) MEFS OR AHRRΔ8, THE ACTIVE ISOFORM OF AHRR, IN TIPARP(-/-) MEFS REDUCED TCDD-INDUCED CYP1A1 MRNA LEVELS, SUGGESTING THAT THEY INDEPENDENTLY REPRESS AHR.|||[24806346]TAKEN TOGETHER, AHRR AND TIPARP REPRESS AHR TRANSACTIVATION BY SIMILAR, BUT ALSO DIFFERENT MECHANISMS.|||[24795504]AHR IN FIBROBLASTS WAS ACTIVATED BY TCDD WITH AN INCREASED EXPRESSION OF CYP1A1 AND CYP1B1.|||[24743890]DRES ARE LOCATED UPSTREAM OF CYTOCHROME P4501A1 (CYP1A1) AND OTHER AHR-RESPONSIVE GENES, AND BINDING OF THE AHR COMPLEX STIMULATES THEIR TRANSCRIPTION.|||[24736433]TOBACCO SMOKE ACTIVATES AHR SIGNALING LEADING TO INCREASED TRANSCRIPTION OF CYP1A1 AND CYP1B1, WHICH ENCODE PROTEINS THAT CONVERT PAHS TO MUTAGENS.|||[24736433]IT IS POSSIBLE, THEREFORE, THAT AHR-DEPENDENT EXPRESSION OF CYP1A1 AND CYP1B1 MIGHT BE AFFECTED BY P53 STATUS.|||[24675095]THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR REPRESSOR (AHRR) IS A TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSOR OF ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) AND HYPOXIA-INDUCIBLE FACTOR (HIF) AND IS REGULATED BY AN AHR-DEPENDENT MECHANISM.|||[24639079]THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THIS PPARΒ/Δ-DEPENDENT REDUCTION OF AHR SIGNALING BY PAH ARE NOT DUE TO ALTERATIONS IN THE EXPRESSION OF AHR AUXILIARY PROTEINS, LIGAND BINDING OR AHR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATION BETWEEN GENOTYPES, BUT ARE LIKELY INFLUENCED BY PPARΒ/Δ-DEPENDENT DEMETHYLATION OF AHR TARGET GENE PROMOTERS INCLUDING CYP1A1 THAT REDUCES AHR ACCESSIBILITY AS SHOWN BY REDUCED PROMOTER OCCUPANCY.|||[24588654]BENZO(A)PYRENE (BAP), A POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBON (PAH), IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANT THAT CAN INDUCE CYTOCHROME P4501A1 (CYP1A1) UPREGULATION VIA ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) ACTIVATION AND PROVOKE INFLAMMATION.|||[24583342]GENE REPORTER ASSAYS SHOWED THAT PALMATINE SIGNIFICANTLY ACTIVATED THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) AND INCREASED THE ACTIVITY OF CYP1A1 GENE PROMOTER IN TRANSIENTLY TRANSFECTED HEPG2 CELLS.|||[24565903]QRT-PCR WAS APPLIED TO ASSESS THE EXPRESSION OF AHR, AHRR (AHR REPRESSOR), ARNT (AHR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR) AS WELL AS AHR DEPENDENT GENES: CYP1A1 AND CYP1B1.|||[24565903]RESULTS: IN GENERAL, DIOXIN DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE THE EXPRESSION OF AHR AND ARNT, BUT REDUCED AHRR LEVEL.|||[24565903]TNF-Α SIGNIFICANTLY INDUCED AHR ALONG WITH CYP1A1 AND CYP1B1 EXPRESSION.|||[24565903]IL-1Β DID NOT AFFECT AHR EXPRESSION, AND HAD MINIMAL EFFECTS ON CYP1 MRNA LEVELS.|||[24563545]ACTIVATION OF AH-RESPONSIVE GENES DEMONSTRATED THAT TRYPTAMINE AND INDOLE 3-ACETATE WERE AHR AGONISTS, WHEREAS INDOLE WAS AN AHR ANTAGONIST THAT INHIBITED TCDD (2,3,7,8-TETRACHLORODIBENZO-P-DIOXIN)-INDUCED CYP1A1 EXPRESSION.|||[24486526]D2 SUPPRESSES THE RECRUITMENT OF ARNT TO THE CYP1A1 PROMOTER BUT NOT TO THE CYP1B1 PROMOTER, PARTLY BECAUSE THE AHR/ARNT HETERODIMER BINDS BETTER TO THE CYP1B1 DRE THAN TO THE CYP1A1 DRE.|||[24472612]IN CONTRAST, INDUCTION OF AHR TARGET GENES APPEARED NOT TO BE ANTAGONIZED BY THE COMPONENTS OF COMPLEX MIXTURES, AS INDUCTION OF CYP1A1, CYP1B1 AND TIPARP TRANSCRIPTS REACHED MAXIMUM LEVELS INDUCED BY PAHS.|||[24382322]ACTIVATED AHR CAN INDUCE CYP1A1 TRANSCRIPTION BY BINDING TO THE XENOBIOTIC RESPONSIVE ELEMENT (XRE).|||[24355420]ADDITIONALLY, HYPOXIA PRE-TREATMENT REDUCED PCB 126 INDUCED AHR BINDING TO CYP1 TARGET GENE PROMOTERS.|||[24355420]OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT AHR ACTIVATION AND CYP1A1 EXPRESSION INDUCED BY PCB 126 WERE SIGNIFICANTLY INHIBITED BY HYPOXIA AND HYPOXIA MIGHT THEREFORE PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PCB METABOLISM AND TOXICITY.|||[24330582]RESULTS: RECENTLY, WE IDENTIFIED THAT GLUCOSE DEPRIVATION INDUCES AHR TRANSLOCATION INTO THE NUCLEUS AND INCREASES CYP1A1 AND 1A2 EXPRESSION IN HEPG2 CELLS.|||[24302727]HERE, WE SHOW THAT INFLAMMATORY STIMULI SUCH AS LPS INDUCE THE EXPRESSION OF AHR IN HUMAN DENDRITIC CELLS (DC) ASSOCIATED WITH AN AHR-DEPENDENT INCREASE OF CYP1A1 (CYTOCHROME P4501A1).|||[24302727]IN VIVO DATA CONFIRMED THE ELEVATED EXPRESSION OF AHR BY LPS AND THE LPS-ENHANCED 2,3,7,8-TETRACHLORODIBENZO-P-DIOXIN (TCDD)-MEDIATED INDUCTION OF CYP1A1 IN THYMUS OF B6 MICE.|||[24302727]AHR EXPRESSION AND TCDD-MEDIATED INDUCTION OF CYP1A1 WAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED IN RELA-DEFICIENT MEF COMPARED WITH WILD TYPE MEF CELLS AND ECTOPIC EXPRESSION OF RELA RESTORED THE EXPRESSION OF AHR AND INDUCTION OF CYP1A1 IN MEF RELA NULL CELLS.|||[24265133]OMEPRAZOLE (OME) INDUCES THE EXPRESSION OF GENES ENCODING DRUG-METABOLIZING ENZYMES, SUCH AS CYP1A1, VIA ACTIVATION OF THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) BOTH IN VIVO AND IN VITRO.|||[24265133]FROM THESE OBSERVATIONS, WE SPECULATED THAT OME-MEDIATED AHR TARGET GENE TRANSCRIPTION IS DUE TO AHR ACTIVATION BY INCREASING AMOUNTS OF PUTATIVE AHR LIGANDS IN SERUM BY INHIBITION OF CYP1A1 ACTIVITY.|||[24176857]HERE WE REPORT THAT MIR-125B IS TRANSACTIVATED BY NRF2 AND INHIBITS ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) REPRESSOR (AHRR).|||[24176857]AN INTEGRATIVE NETWORK OF MIRNA AND MESSENGER RNA CHANGES ENABLED US TO PREDICT MIR-125B AS AN INHIBITOR OF AHRR FOR THE CONTROL OF AHR ACTIVITY AND CELL SURVIVAL.|||[24176857]IN OUR MOLECULAR STUDY, MIR-125B INHIBITED AHRR AND THEREBY ACTIVATED AHR, LEADING TO THE INDUCTION OF MDM2.|||[24161567]METHODS: USING PRIMARY NORMAL HUMAN EPIDERMAL KERATINOCYTES (NHEK), WE STUDIED AHR ACTIVATION BY XRE-LUCIFERASE, AHR DEGRADATION AND CYP1A1 INDUCTION.|||[24161567]CONCLUSION: LIGAND-INDUCED CYP1A1 AND AHR DEGRADATION DID NOT CORRELATE WITH THEIR CHLORACNEGENIC POTENTIAL, INDICATING THAT NEITHER CYP1A1 NOR AHR ARE SUITABLE BIOMARKERS.|||[24161444]ACTIVATION OF THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) ULTIMATELY LEADS TO THE INDUCTION OF THE CARCINOGEN-ACTIVATING ENZYME CYTOCHROME P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), AND ACTIVATION OF THE NUCLEAR FACTOR-ERYTHROID 2 P45-RELATED FACTOR 2 (NRF2) IN ADDITION TO THE AHR PATHWAY INDUCES THE EXPRESSION OF THE NADP(H):QUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE (NQO1).|||[24161444]THEREFORE, THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF AS(III) PENTAVALENT METABOLITES, MMA(V), DMA(V), AND TMA(V), ON AHR AND NRF2 ACTIVATION AND ON THE EXPRESSION OF THEIR PROTOTYPICAL DOWNSTREAM TARGETS CYP1A1 AND NQO1, RESPECTIVELY.|||[24161444]UPON KNOCKDOWN OF AHR AND NRF2 THE MMA(V)-, DMA(V)-, AND TMA(V)-MEDIATED INDUCTION OF BOTH CYP1A1 AND NQO1 PROTEINS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED.|||[24161444]IN CONCLUSION, THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT METHYLATED PENTAVALENT ARSENIC METABOLITES ARE BIFUNCTIONAL INDUCERS, AS THEY INCREASE CYP1A1 BY ACTIVATING THE AHR/XRE SIGNALING PATHWAY AND THEY INCREASE NQO1 BY ACTIVATING THE NRF2/ARE SIGNALING PATHWAY IN ADDITION TO THE AHR/XRE PATHWAY.|||[24157406]IN BOTH TESTS, EVALUATING THE ABILITY OF THE COMPLEXES TO MODULATE THE EXPRESSION OF CYP1A1, CYP1A2 AND CYP3A4 IN PRIMARY HUMAN HEPATOCYTES AND INFLUENCE THE TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVITY OF AHR AND GR IN THE REPORTER CELL LINES, NO NEGATIVE INFLUENCE ON THE MAJOR DRUG-METABOLIZING CYTOCHROME P450 ISOENZYMES AND THEIR SIGNALING PATHWAY (THROUGH GR AND AHR RECEPTORS) WAS OBSERVED.|||[24091107]DEXAMETHASONE ACCELERATES DEGRADATION OF ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) AND SUPPRESSES CYP1A1 INDUCTION IN PLACENTAL JEG-3 CELL LINE.|||[24091107]WE EXAMINED WHETHER GLUCOCORTICOID DEXAMETHASONE INFLUENCES AHR-MEDIATED INDUCTION OF CYP1A1 ENZYME IN THE JEG-3 CELL LINE.|||[24091107]WE CAN CONCLUDE THAT DEXAMETHASONE SUPPRESSES AHR-MEDIATED CYP1A1 INDUCTION IN JEG-3 CELLS THROUGH THE UNIQUE MECHANISM OF AHR-GR CROSSTALK, WHICH INVOLVES ACCELERATED DEGRADATION OF AHR.|||[24058584]EXPRESSION OF ESTROGEN RECEPTOR Α (ERΑ) AND AHR-MEDIATED TRANSCRIPTIONAL INDUCTION OF CYP1A1 CAN SENSITIZE BREAST CANCER CELLS TO AF.|||[24058584]IN VITRO AND IN VIVO MECHANISTIC STUDIES SUGGESTED THAT VORINOSTAT REACTIVATED ERΑ EXPRESSION AND RESTORED AHR-MEDIATED TRANSCRIPTIONAL INDUCTION OF CYP1A1.|||[23994263]INDUCTION OF CYTOCHROME P450 CYP1 EXPRESSION BY E5M WAS ACCOMPANIED BY TRANSLOCATION OF THE LIGAND-ACTIVATED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR AHR TO THE NUCLEUS, AS DEMONSTRATED BY CONFOCAL IMMUNOFLUORESENCE.|||[23957354]IN ADDITION, THE AHB INCREASED CYP1A1 ACTIVITY THROUGH AHR-XRE PATHWAY ACTIVATION.|||[23776647]NOT ONLY DID SELECTED GINSENOSIDES PREFERENTIALLY ACTIVATE THE AHR FROM ONE SPECIES AND NOT OTHERS, MOUSE CELL LINE WAS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY LESS RESPONSIVE TO THESE CHEMICALS THAN RAT AND GUINEA PIG CELL LINES, BUT THE ENDOGENOUS GENE CYP1A1 COULD STILL BE INDUCTED IN MOUSE CELL LINE.|||[23776235]HERE, WE SHOW THAT THE SMOKE TOXINS BENZO(A)PYRENE (BAP) AND 2,3,7,8-TETRACHLORODIBENZO-P-DIOXIN (TCDD) INTERACT WITH THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) TO INDUCE OSTEOCLASTIC BONE RESORPTION THROUGH THE ACTIVATION OF CYTOCHROME P450 1A/1B (CYP1) ENZYMES.|||[23776235]THE RECEPTOR ACTIVATOR OF NF-ΚB LIGAND (RANK-L) ALSO FAILED TO INDUCE THE EXPRESSION OF CYP1 ENZYMES IN AHR(-/-) CELLS.|||[23776235]FURTHERMORE, THE OSTEOCLASTOGENESIS INDUCED BY TCDD WAS LOWER IN CYP1A1/1A2(-/-) AND CYP1A1/1A2/1B1(-/-) CULTURES, INDICATING THAT AHR WAS UPSTREAM OF THE CYP ENZYMES.|||[23768840]BLOOD SAMPLES WERE PROCESSED FOR GENOTYPING FOR THE SELECTED POLYMORPHISMS: AHR (RS2066853), AHR REPRESSOR (AHRR) (RS2292596), ARYL HYDROCARBON NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT)

SENSITIVE TO 5F203.|||[23696052]IN CONTRAST, 5F203 FAILED TO INDUCE CYP1A1 EXPRESSION, AHR TRANSLOCATION OR OXIDATIVE STRESS IN 5F203-RESISTANT SKOV-3 CELLS, OR IN OVARIAN CANCER ASCITES CELLS INHERENTLY RESISTANT TO THIS AGENT.|||[23648678]AHR ACTIVITY IS ITSELF REGULATED BY OTHER TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS, INCLUDING THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR REPRESSOR (AHRR).|||[23614742]AHR KNOCKDOWN

CRITICAL FOR INHIBITION OF PROLIFERATION, WHICH IS NOT AFFECTED BY Α-NAPHTHOFLAVONE-MEDIATED INHIBITION OF CYP1A1 ACTIVITY NOR MODULATED BY AHR SILENCING.|||[23528250]DIOXINS ARE METABOLIZED BY CYTOCHROME P450, FAMILY 1 (CYP1) VIA THE AROMATIC HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR).|||[23528250]WE DETERMINED WHETHER DIFFERENT BLOOD DIOXIN CONCENTRATIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH POLYMORPHISMS IN AHR (DBSNP

THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT AHR AGONISTS OF YEAST ORIGIN ARE ABLE TO INHIBIT MODC RESPONSES TO TLR LIGANDS AND THAT MODCS CAN ADAPT THROUGH INCREASED TRANSCRIPTION OF METABOLIZING ENZYMES SUCH AS

THE TRANSACTIVATION WAS DUE TO THE ACTIVATION OF A REGION LOCATED AT -1137 TO +59 BP FROM CYP1A1, IN PARTICULAR, FOUR XENOBIOTIC RESPONSIVE ELEMENTS (XRES) EXISTING IN THE REGION.|||[22234961]ACTIVATION OF AHR MEDIATES THE EXPRESSION OF TARGET GENES (E.G., CYP1A1) BY BINDING TO DIOXIN RESPONSE ELEMENT (DRE) SEQUENCES IN THEIR PROMOTER REGION.|||[22197899]HOWEVER, IN

BOTH HUMAN HEPATOCYTES AND HEPARG CELLS.|||[20553787]IN ADDITION, THE SAME AMOUNTS OF CHRYSOERIOL SIGNIFICANTLY INHIBITED THE BINDING OF BAP TO THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR), WHICH IS THE KEY FACTOR CONCERNING THE INDUCTION OF THE CYP1 FAMILIES.|||[20307623]AHR EXPRESSION LEVEL WAS LOWER THAN CYP1A1 IN BASAL CONDITIONS AND FOLLOWING INDUCTION.|||[20228066]BOTH QUANTITATIVE PCR AND IMMUNOBLOT ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT INDUCTION OF THE HYPOXIA RESPONSE PATHWAY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE LEVELS OF AHR DOWNSTREAM TARGETS CYP1A1 AND CYP1B1 AND AHR PROTEIN BINDING TO

THAT TSU-16 BINDS TO AND ACTIVATES AHR TO ENHANCE THE EXPRESSION OF BOTH HUMAN CYP1A1 AND CYP1A2.|||[20132803]IN THIS STUDY, WE USED THE HUMAN HEPATOMA CELL LINE HEPG2 TO INVESTIGATE IN MORE DETAIL

CYP1B1, UGT1A1, UGT1A6, IL6, AND SAA1.|||[19969063]ALTHOUGH INDUCTION OF CYP1 FAMILY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT EFFECT OF AHR ACTIVATION, THE ROLE OF CYP1 INDUCTION IN MEDIATING THE CARDIOTOXIC EFFECT OF TCDD IS USUALLY OVERLOOKED.|||[19903824]AHR-MEDIATED TOXICITY IS PRIMARILY DERIVED FROM AHR BINDING TO ITS DIOXIN RESPONSE ELEMENT (DRE) AND DRIVING EXPRESSION OF CYP1 FAMILY MEMBERS, WHICH HAVE THE CAPACITY TO METABOLIZE PROCARCINOGENS TO GENOTOXIC CARCINOGENS.|||[19903824]FURTHERMORE, ACTIVATION OF AHR BY WAY-169916 FAILS TO STIMULATE CANONICAL DRE-DRIVEN AHR-MEDIATED CYP1A1 EXPRESSION, THUS ELIMINATING THE POTENTIAL FOR AHR-MEDIATED GENOTOXIC STRESS.|||[19880377]FURTHERMORE, BBN-INDUCED UGT1A DOWN-REGULATION WAS LOST IN AHR KO MICE, AND THE CANONICAL AHR TARGET GENE CYP1A1 WAS SIMILARLY

CYTOKINE/CHEMOKINE RESPONSES IN BEAS-2B CELLS.|||[19831498]SIMILAR TO THE INDUCTION OF CYTOCHROME-1 (CYP1) ENZYMES, THE INDUCTION OF HUMAN UGT1A6 WAS DUE TO THE BINDING OF AHR TO A COMMON BINDING

MESSENGER RNA (MRNA) EXPRESSION IN T24 CELLS WITH SMALL INTERFERING RNA (SIRNA) DOWNREGULATED THE MRNA EXPRESSION OF AHR, CYP1A1, CYP1B1, MMP-1, MMP-2 AND MMP-9; FURTHERMORE, THE CELLS TRANSFECTED WITH SIRNA FOR AHR SHOWED DECREASED INVASION ACTIVITY IN COMPARISON WITH THE CELLS TRANSFECTED WITH A NON-TARGETING SIRNA.|||[19747074]HOMEOSTATIC FEEDBACK LOOPS MIGHT NOT ONLY INCLUDE CYP1A1 BUT ALSO PHASE II ENZYMES SUCH AS UGT1A1 WHICH CONTROLS THE ANTIOXIDANT AHR LIGAND BILIRUBIN.|||[19619570]WE FOUND THAT LTEE CELLS, IN COMPARISON WITH CONTROL CELLS, HAD HIGHER LEVELS OF AHR MRNA AND PROTEIN, GREATER RESPONSIVENESS FOR AHR-REGULATED CYP1A1 AND CYP1B1 INDUCTION, A 6-FOLD HIGHER INITIAL LEVEL OF BENZO(A)PYRENE-DNA ADDUCTS AS DETERMINED BY LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY TANDEM MASS SPECTROMETRY,

AND PROTEIN EXPRESSION WERE INCREASED IN A DOSE-DEPENDENT MANNER FOLLOWING TCDD TREATMENT AND AHR ANTAGONIST RESVERATROL (RSV) COULD REVERSE THIS TCDD-INDUCED CYP1A1 EXPRESSION.|||[19287966]NONE OF THESE CELL LINES SHOWED SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN MRNA LEVELS OF ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) AND AHR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT), WHICH ARE KNOWN TO DIRECTLY ACTIVATE CYP1 TRANSCRIPTION.|||[19287966]THIS OBSERVATION SUGGESTED THAT EXPRESSION OF CYP1B1, BUT NOT CYP1A1, WAS DOWNREGULATED BY PROMOTER METHYLATION RATHER THAN DECREASED EXPRESSION OF AHR/ARNT.|||[19270430]IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATED THE MECHANISM FOR THE REPRESSION OF 3-METHYLCHOLANTHRENE (3MC)-INDUCED TRANSCRIPTION OF AHR-REGULATED GENES, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, AND AHR REPRESSOR (AHRR), BY 5ALPHA-DIHYDROTESTSTERONE (DHT) IN LNCAP AND T47D CELLS, WHICH ARE ANDROGEN RECEPTOR (AR)- AND AHR-POSITIVE.|||[19270430]THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT COMPLEX FORMATION BETWEEN ACTIVATED AR AND AHR PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE SUPPRESSION OF 3MC-INDUCED TRANSCRIPTION OF CYP1 FAMILY GENES BY DHT.|||[19268519]CULTURED HUMAN HEPG2 CELLS WERE INCUBATED WITH AA WITH OR WITHOUT THE POTENT AHR AGONIST/CYP1A1 INDUCER 2,3,7,8-TETRACHLORIDIBENXO-P-DIOXIN (TCDD).|||[19265716]WE SHOW THAT THESE COMPOUNDS ARE HIGH-AFFINITY LIGANDS FOR THE RAT AHR, BUT A QUANTITATIVE ASSAY FOR THEIR ABILITY TO INDUCE CYP1A1 RNA IN H4IIEC3 CELLS, A MEASURE OF ACTIVATION OF THE AHR, SHOWED A POOR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AFFINITY FOR THE AHR AND ABILITY TO INDUCE CYP1A1 RNA.|||[19255421]MOST OF THE EFFECTS OF DIOXIN ARE ATTRIBUTED TO ITS ACTIVATION OF THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR), A TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR THAT BINDS TO THE AH RECEPTOR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT) TO REGULATE THE TRANSCRIPTION OF NUMEROUS GENES, INCLUDING CYP1A1 AND CYP1B1.|||[19255421]IN THE CYP1A1 ENHANCER, EGFR ACTIVATION PREVENTS RECRUITMENT OF THE P300 COACTIVATOR, ALTHOUGH NOT AFFECTING THE BINDING OF THE AHR OR

ASSAYS WITH DELETION CONSTRUCTS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE OMEPRAZOLE-INDUCED EXPRESSION OF BOTH CYP1A1 AND CYP1A2 IS MEDIATED VIA THE COMMON REGULATORY REGION CONTAINING MULTIPLE AHR-BINDING MOTIFS (THE NUCLEOTIDES FROM -464 TO -1829 OF HUMAN CYP1A1), WHICH IS IDENTICAL WITH THE REGION FOR BNF AND 3MC INDUCTION.|||[18372000]BAP ACTIVATES THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) AND INDUCES THE EXPRESSION OF A BATTERY OF GENES, INCLUDING CYP1A1, WHICH METABOLIZE BAP TO TOXIC COMPOUNDS.|||[18372000]IN THIS STUDY, WE ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF CYP1 ENZYMES (CYP1A1, CYP1A2 AND CYP1B1) ON BAP-INDUCED AHR TRANSACTIVATION AND DNA ADDUCT FORMATION IN HEK293 CELLS AND HEPG2 CELLS.|||[18372000]TRANSFECTION OF CYP1A1 AND CYP1B1, BUT NOT CYP1A2, SUPPRESSED BAP-INDUCED ACTIVATION OF AHR.|||[18329192]IT IS POSSIBLE THAT DIOXINS CONTRIBUTE TO THE PATHOGENESIS THROUGH ACTIVATION OF ARYL-HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR)-MEDIATED TRANSCRIPTION AND DOWNSTREAM GENES SUCH AS CYP1A1, GSTA1 AND TGF-ALPHA.|||[18329192]COMPARED WITH CONTROLS, AHR, CYP1A1, GSTA1 AND C-FOS TRANSACTIVATIONS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY INDUCED IN THE SKINS OF CHLORACNE PATIENTS WHO HAD LONG-TERM EXPOSURE TO DIOXINS AND DIBENZOFURANES.|||[18226074]IN OUR STUDY, WE FOUND THAT BIRTH WEIGHT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AMONG INFANTS BORN TO SMOKING WOMEN HAVING THE SPECIFIC AHR, CYP1A1, GSTM1, CYP2E1 AND NQO1 GENOTYPES.|||[18179178]IN CONTRAST TO PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED DATA, BOTH M50354 AND M50367 WERE FOUND TO BE POTENT INDUCERS OF SEVERAL AHR TARGET GENES, NAMELY, CYP1A1, CYP1B1, AND UGT1A2.|||[18096572]ARNT2 EXPRESSED IN HEPA-1 CELL CULTURE LINES WITH REDUCED ARNT PROTEIN RESULTED IN MINIMAL INDUCTION OF ENDOGENOUS CYP1A1 PROTEIN COMPARED TO CELLS EXPRESSING ARNT, AND MUTATION OF THE PUTATIVE PROLINE RESIDUE AT AMINO ACID 352 TO HISTIDINE FAILED TO PRODUCE AN ARNT2 THAT COULD FUNCTION IN AHR-MEDIATED SIGNALING.|||[18096572]HOWEVER, THE EXPRESSION OF ARNT2 IN WILD-TYPE HEPA-1 CELLS REDUCED TCDD-MEDIATED INDUCTION OF ENDOGENOUS CYP1A1 PROTEIN BY 30%, EVEN THOUGH AHR*ARNT2 COMPLEXES COULD NOT BE DETECTED IN NUCLEAR EXTRACTS.|||[18089838]CHEMICAL INHIBITION OF THIS PATHWAY USING THE CAM ANTAGONIST W7 OR THE CAMK INHIBITOR KN-93 STRONGLY REDUCED TCDD-MEDIATED INDUCTION OF THE AHR TARGET GENE CYP1A1.|||[18089838]BOTH KN-93 AND SIRNA TARGETING CAMKIALPHA WERE FOUND TO ABOLISH TCDD-MEDIATED ACTIVATION OF CYP1A1 PROMOTER AND TCDD-TRIGGERED NUCLEAR IMPORT OF AHR, A CRUCIAL STEP OF THE AHR SIGNALING PATHWAY.|||[18074135]WE ALSO OBSERVED ALTERED EXPRESSION OF THE TWO MAJOR TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS (AHR AND ARNT) THAT AFFECT CYP1A1 EXPRESSION WHEN BRCA1 PROTEIN LEVELS ARE ALTERED.|||[18065768]AIMS: WE INVESTIGATED THE MECHANISMS OF SHEAR STRESS (SS)-INDUCED ACTIVATION OF CYTOCHROME P450 (CYP) 1A1 AND CELL CYCLE ARREST WITH REGARD TO THE ROLE OF THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR), SINCE AHR MEDIATES THE EXPRESSION OF CYP1A1 INDUCED BY POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS (PAHS) AND IS THOUGHT TO BE INVOLVED IN THE REGULATION OF CELL GROWTH AND DIFFERENTIATION.|||[18065768]CONCLUSION: LAMINAR SS STIMULATED THE TRANSCRIPTION OF CYP1A1 THROUGH THE ACTIVATION OF AHR IN A WAY THAT IS SIMILAR TO THE EFFECTS OF PAHS.|||[18059023]AF INDUCES DNA-PROTEIN CROSS-LINKS (DPCS), GAMMA-H2AX PHOSPHORYLATION, ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) SIGNALING, APOPTOSIS AND ITS OWN METABOLISM VIA CYTOCHROME P4501A1 AND 1A2 (CYP1A1/1A2) ACTIVATION IN SENSITIVE ESTROGEN RECEPTOR POSITIVE (ER+) MCF7 BREAST CANCER CELLS.|||[18059014]WHILE INCREASING AHR BINDING TO BOTH CYP1A1 AND CYP1B1, 2,3,7,8-TETRACHLORODIBENZO-P-DIOXIN INDUCED CYP1A1 MRNA IN BOTH A MALIGNANT AND NON-MALIGNANT LINE BUT INCREASED ONLY CYP1B1 MRNA IN THE MALIGNANT LINE, AGAIN DEMONSTRATING THAT THE LEVEL OF PROMOTER BINDING DOES NOT NECESSARILY CORRELATE WITH GENE MRNA LEVELS.|||[18001219]WE FOUND THAT TCDD STIMULATED THE BINDING OF THE AHR TO COX-2 AND CYTOCHROME P4501A1 (CYP1A1) OLIGONUCLEOTIDES CONTAINING CONSENSUS XRES.|||[18001219]THE TCDD-INDUCED BINDING OF THE AHR TO COX-2 AND CYP1A1 OLIGONUCLEOTIDES WAS REPRESSED BY COTREATMENT WITH CLA (T10,C12-CLA > C9,T11-CLA), AND THE AHR ANTAGONISTS, 3-METHOXY-4-NAPHTHOFLAVONE, AND RESVERATROL.|||[18000031]THE AHR REPRESSOR (AHRR) INHIBITS AHR SIGNALING THROUGH A PROPOSED MECHANISM INVOLVING COMPETITION WITH AHR FOR DIMERIZATION WITH AHR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT) AND BINDING TO AHR-RESPONSIVE ENHANCER ELEMENTS (AHRES).|||[18000031]IN TRANSIENT TRANSFECTIONS IN WHICH AHR2-DEPENDENT TRANSACTIVATION WAS REPRESSED BY AHRR1 OR AHRR2, INCREASING ARNT EXPRESSION FAILED TO REVERSE THE REPRESSION, SUGGESTING THAT AHRR INHIBITION OF AHR SIGNALING DOES NOT OCCUR THROUGH SEQUESTRATION OF ARNT.|||[18000031]THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT REPRESSION OF AHR TRANSACTIVATION BY AHRR INVOLVES THE N-TERMINAL PORTION OF AHRR; DOES NOT INVOLVE COMPETITION FOR ARNT; AND DOES NOT REQUIRE BINDING TO AHRES, ALTHOUGH AHRE BINDING CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE REPRESSION.|||[18000031]WE PROPOSE A MECHANISM OF AHRR ACTION INVOLVING ""TRANSREPRESSION"" OF AHR SIGNALING THROUGH PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS RATHER THAN BY INHIBITION OF THE FORMATION OR DNA BINDING OF THE AHR-ARNT COMPLEX.|||[17980155]TWO MEMBERS OF THE 'AHR FAMILY' (A FAMILY WHICH IS PART OF THE BHLH-PAS SUPERFAMILY), ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) AND AHR REPRESSOR (AHRR), ORIGINATED FROM A COMMON ANCESTOR AND FORM A REGULATORY CIRCUIT IN XENOBIOTIC SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION.|||[17968679]IN CONCLUSION, CONSTITUTIVE CYP1A1 MRNA EXPRESSION IS DEPENDENT ON AHR AND IS REDUCED BY HYPOXIA VIA A HIF-2ALPHA-DEPENDENT MECHANISM, WHICH MAY BE MEDIATED BY A HIF-2ALPHA-DEPENDENT REDUCTION OF AHR EXPRESSION.|||[17959153]CONSISTENT WITH THE RECENT REPORT, SP600125 DOSE-DEPENDENTLY INHIBITED CYP1A1 AND CYP1A2 GENES INDUCTION BY A PROTOTYPE AHR LIGAND 2,3,7,8-TETRACHLORODIBENZO-P-DIOXIN (TCDD) IN HUMAN HEPATOCYTES.|||[17949687]THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR REPRESSOR (AHRR) HAS BEEN PROPOSED TO INHIBIT ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) ACTIVITY BY COMPETING WITH AHR FOR FORMING A HETERODIMER WITH AHR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT) AND SUBSEQUENTLY BINDING TO THE XENOBIOTIC RESPONSIVE ELEMENTS (XRE).|||[17912254]THESE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE GREATER IEQS COMPARED TO THE TEQS FOR DIOXINS, FURANS, AND CERTAIN PCBS SUGGESTS THAT HUMAN BLOOD CONTAINS A RELATIVELY HIGH LEVEL OF AHR AGONISTS ABLE TO ACTIVATE THE CYP1A1 DIOXIN RESPONSE ELEMENT (DRE)-LINKED REPORTER GENE BIOASSAY AND THAT THIS AHR ACTIVITY IS NOT ACCOUNTED FOR BY PCDDS/FS AND DIOXIN-LIKE PCBS BASED ON STANDARD HR-GC/MS AND TEF ANALYSIS.|||[17890447]THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR REPRESSOR (AHRR) IS A MEMBER OF THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) SIGNALING CASCADE, WHICH MEDIATES DIOXIN TOXICITY AND IS INVOLVED IN REGULATION OF CELL GROWTH AND DIFFERENTIATION.|||[17890447]THE AHRR WAS DESCRIBED AS A FEEDBACK MODULATOR, WHICH COUNTERACTS AHR-DEPENDENT GENE EXPRESSION.|||[17785579]AS EXPECTED, THE CYP1A1 AND CYP1B1 ENHANCERS BIND AHR IN TCDD-TREATED CELLS.|||[17707585]THE TCDD-ACTIVATED ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) INDUCES THE DRE-CALUX ACTIVATION AND CYP1A1 GENE EXPRESSION VIA BINDING TO DRE IN PROMOTER REGIONS OF THESE DIOXIN-RESPONSIVE GENES.|||[17682057]TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE COEXPOSED CELLS TO BINARY MIXTURES OF BENZO[A]PYRENE (B[A]P), AN ENVIRONMENTAL PROCARCINOGEN THAT ACTIVATES CYP1A1 TRANSCRIPTIONAL RESPONSES MEDIATED BY THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR), AND CHROMIUM, A CARCINOGENIC HEAVY METAL THAT REPRESSES B[A]P-INDUCIBLE AHR-MEDIATED GENE EXPRESSION.|||[17682057]WE SHOW THAT CHROMIUM CROSS-LINKS HISTONE DEACETYLASE 1-DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (HDAC1-DNMT1) COMPLEXES TO CYP1A1 PROMOTER CHROMATIN AND INHIBITS HISTONE MARKS INDUCED BY AHR-MEDIATED GENE TRANSACTIVATION, INCLUDING PHOSPHORYLATION OF HISTONE H3 SER-10, TRIMETHYLATION OF H3 LYS-4, AND VARIOUS ACETYLATION MARKS IN HISTONES H3 AND H4.|||[17652329]A RAPID DECREASE IN THE AHR PROTEIN AFTER NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATION IN HEPA1C1C7 CELLS WAS SUGGESTED TO CONTRIBUTE TO SUPPRESSION OF CYP1A1 INDUCTION TO THE SAME LEVEL AS IN HEPG2 CELLS.|||[17599377]TREATMENT WITH 2,3,7,8-TETRACHLORODIBENZO-P-DIOXIN (TCDD) INDUCES CYP1A1 PROTEIN AND MRNA LEVELS AND ALSO ACTIVATES INHIBITORY AHR-ERALPHA CROSSTALK ASSOCIATED WITH HORMONE-INDUCED REPORTER GENE EXPRESSION.|||[17599377]THIS WAS NOT ACCOMPANIED BY DECREASED NUCLEAR AHR LEVELS OR DECREASED INTERACTION OF THE AHR COMPLEX WITH THE CYP1A1 GENE PROMOTER AS DETERMINED IN A CHROMATIN IMMUNOPRECIPITATION ASSAY.|||[17560011]ADDITIONALLY, AML1-ETO PROTEIN ALSO INCREASED AHR EXPRESSION, A LIGAND-ACTIVATED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR THAT MEDIATES PAHS-INDUCED CYP1A1 GENE EXPRESSION.|||[17559847]OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE POLYMORPHISMS IN ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR), ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR REPRESSOR (AHRR), AND ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR (ARNT) GENES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH MALE FACTOR INFERTILITY.|||[17512696]IN CONTRAST TO PCB126, PCB39, WHICH COULD NOT ACTIVATE AHR AND LACKED EFFECT ON CYP1A1, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED CYP19 MRNA EXPRESSION.|||[17511620]IN THE PRESENT STUDY WE EXAMINED THE ABILITY OF 3,3',4,4',5-PENTACHLORINATED BIPHENYL [PCB126 (POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYL 126)], A PROTOTYPICAL AHR (ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR) AGONIST, AND 2,2',4,6,6'-PCB (PCB104), WHICH DOES NOT ACTIVATE AHR, TO INDUCE THE RECRUITMENT OF ERALPHA (OESTROGEN RECEPTOR ALPHA) TO CYP1A1 (CYTOCHROME P4501A1 GENE) AND CYP1B1 PROMOTERS IN T-47D HUMAN BREAST CANCER CELLS AND OTHER CELL LINES.|||[17511620]DESPITE NO INCREASE IN AHR-MEDIATED GENE EXPRESSION, CHIP ASSAYS REVEALED THAT ERALPHADELTAAF1 WAS PRESENT AT CYP1A1 AND CYP1B1 PROMOTERS.|||[17445780]TREATMENT OF CELLS WITH THE CALPAIN INHIBITORS: CALPEPTIN, CALPAIN INHIBITOR III, OR PD150606 EITHER INDIVIDUALLY OR IN COMBINATIONS UP TO 75 MICROM DID NOT REDUCE TCDD-INDUCED DEGRADATION OF THE AHR, THE INDUCTION OF ENDOGENOUS CYP1A1 OR THE NUCLEAR ACCUMULATION OF THE AHR.|||[17445780]INHIBITION OF AHR DEGRADATION WITH THESE COMPOUNDS DID NOT REDUCE THE INDUCTION OF ENDOGENOUS CYP1A1.|||[17376491]NO INCREASED GENE EXPRESSION (MCP-1, CYP1A1 AND 1B1) WAS FOUND UPON INCUBATION WITH THE STRUCTURAL ISOMER BENZO[E]PYRENE, WHICH IS A WEAK AHR AGONIST.|||[17327465]THE CURRENT STUDY EVALUATES THE SPECIFICITY OF CYP1A1 INDUCTION AS A MARKER FOR AHR AFFINITY AND ACTIVATION AND PROVIDES CONTEXT TO ASSESS THE RELEVANCY OF AHR ACTIVATION TO RISK ASSESSMENT.|||[17327465]WHEREAS IN VIVO CYP1A1 MRNA EXPRESSION IS A SENSITIVE MARKER FOR AHR ACTIVATION, IT LACKS SPECIFICITY, BECAUSE 81 (59%) OF 137 COMPOUNDS WERE FOUND TO SIGNIFICANTLY INDUCE CYP1A1 IN VIVO BUT WERE NOT VERIFIED TO BIND OR ACTIVATE THE AHR IN VITRO.|||[17327465]THESE DATA DEMONSTRATE THAT INDUCTION OF CYP1A1 IS A NONSPECIFIC BIOMARKER OF DIRECT AHR AFFINITY AND ACTIVATION AND LEND FURTHER SUPPORT TO THE HYPOTHESIS THAT CYP1A1 INDUCTION AND/OR AHR ACTIVATION IS NOT SYNONYMOUS WITH DIOXIN-LIKE TOXICITY.|||[17311112]THE INFLUENCE OF AN ANTIESTROGEN, INDOLE-3-CARBINOL (I3C) ON THE EXPRESSION OF CYP1A1, CYP1B1 AND AHR GENES WAS INVESTIGATED IN AN ATTEMPT TO ESTABLISH WHETHER I3C COULD INCREASE THE EXPRESSION OF GENES INVOLVED IN ESTRONE METABOLISM.|||[17283379]THIS STUDY PROVIDES THE FIRST EVIDENCE FOR THE ABILITY OF KTZ AND ITZ TO INDUCE THE CYP1A1 GENE EXPRESSION THROUGH AN AHR-DEPENDENT MECHANISM, AND SUGGESTS A NOVEL MECHANISM OF THE KTZ- AND ITZ-MEDIATED TOXICITIES.|||[17266942]LINKAGE BETWEEN AHR AND NRF2 BATTERIES IS PROBABLY ACHIEVED BY MULTIPLE MECHANISMS, INCLUDING NRF2 AS A TARGET GENE OF THE AHR, INDIRECT ACTIVATION OF NRF2 VIA CYP1A1-GENERATED REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES, AND DIRECT CROSS-INTERACTION OF AHR/XRE AND NRF2/ARE SIGNALING.|||[17266942]TIGHTENED COUPLING BETWEEN PHASES I AND II BY AHR- AND NRF2-INDUCED XMES MAY GREATLY ATTENUATE HEALTH RISKS POSED BY CYP1A1-GENERATED TOXIC INTERMEDIATES AND REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES.|||[17244640]THE ANDROGEN RECEPTOR (AR), ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) AND ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR REPRESSOR (AHRR) MAY MODULATE THE EFFECT OF POPS WITH REGARD TO PREVIOUSLY OBSERVED SPERM Y:X RATIO CHANGES.|||[17234337]BY USING REAL-TIME RT-PCR, WE DEMONSTRATED THAT ARECOLINE INHIBITED THE TCDD-INDUCED ACTIVATIONS OF CYP1A1 AND AHR REPRESSOR (AHRR) MRNA EXPRESSION IN A SIMILAR PATTERN.|||[17234337]OUR RESULTS REVEALED THAT ARECOLINE INHIBITED AHR MRNA EXPRESSION WITH NO DIRECT EFFECT ON CYP1A1 ENZYME ACTIVITY.|||[17234337]TAKEN TOGETHER, HERE WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT ARECOLINE ATTENUATES THE TCDD-INDUCED CYP1A1 ACTIVATION MAINLY VIA DOWN-REGULATION OF AHR EXPRESSION IN HUMAN HEPATOMA CELLS, SUGGESTING THE POSSIBLE INVOLVEMENT OF ARECOLINE IN THE AHR-MEDIATED METABOLISM OF ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICANTS IN LIVER.|||[17227852]USING THIS SYSTEM, WE SHOW THAT FLUID FLOW INDUCES A ROBUST AHR-MEDIATED INCREASE IN CYP1 EXPRESSION.|||[17200336]PURPOSE: CYP1B1 AND CYP1A1 EXPRESSION IS UP-REGULATED BY ACTIVATION OF THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) THROUGH BINDING OF LIGANDS SUCH AS CIGARETTE SMOKE COMPONENTS.|||[17200336]WE EXAMINED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN AHR, CYP1B1, AND CYP1A1 EXPRESSION IN NONINVASIVE BRONCHIOLOALVEOLAR CARCINOMAS (BAC) AND LUNG ADENOCARCINOMAS AND INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF AHR OVEREXPRESSION ON CELL PHYSIOLOGY.|||[17200336]THE LEVEL OF CYP1B1, BUT NOT CYP1A1, WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH AHR OVEREXPRESSION IN BAC.|||[17200336]2,3,7,8-TETRACHLOROBENZO-P-DIOXIN-INDUCED CYP1A1/1B1 EXPRESSION WAS REDUCED IN AHR RNAI CLONES.|||[17177569]OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT APPLE JUICE EXTRACT CAN ANTAGONIZE TCDD-MEDIATED CYP1A1 INDUCTION BY INTERFERING WITH AHR-DEPENDENT GENE TRANSCRIPTION AND BY INHIBITING THE CATALYTIC ACTIVITY OF CYP1A1.|||[17166882]WE FOUND THAT DBC-DNA ADDUCT LEVELS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN AROMATIC HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR NULL AHR(-/-) MICE, SUGGESTING THAT THE INDUCTION OF AROMATIC HYDROCARBON

INDICATED BY THE OBSERVATIONS THAT THE TCDD AND CSC-INDUCED DECREASES IN P15(INK4B), P16(INK4A) AND P53 EXPRESSION WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THE EXPRESSION LEVELS OF THE AHR TARGET GENE, CYP1A1.|||[17070097]IN ADDITION, COTREATMENT WITH THE AHR ANTAGONIST, 3'-METHOXY-4'-NITROFLAVONE (MNF) BLOCKED THE EFFECTS OF TCDD AND CSC ON P53 AND CYP1A1 EXPRESSION.|||[17065433]THE HUMAN CYP1A1 GENE IS REGULATED BY THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR), AND INDUCTION OF CYP1A1 IS KNOWN TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN XENOBIOTIC METABOLISM.|||[17065433]WHILE FIRST PASS METABOLISM OF B[A]P IN THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT REDUCES THE POTENTIAL OF THE AHR TO INDUCE CYP1A1(GFP) IN THE LIVER, ADEQUATE CONCENTRATIONS REACH THE HEPATIC CIRCULATION AS DEMONSTRATED BY INDUCTION OF HUMAN UGT1A PROTEINS IN TRANSGENIC MICE THAT EXPRESS THE HUMAN UGT1 LOCUS.|||[16972788]MOREOVER, IN CHROMATIN IMMUNOPRECIPITATION ASSAYS, THESE COMPOUNDS INDUCE BINDING OF AHR AND ERALPHA TO THE CYP1A1 AND PS2 GENE PROMOTERS, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THEIR ACTIVITIES AS BOTH SELECTIVE AHR MODULATORS (SAHRMS) AND SELECTIVE ER MODULATORS (SERMS).|||[16968971]A GENERALLY ACCEPTED MODEL FOR CHEMICAL-INDUCED TRANSACTIVATION OF THE CYP1A1 GENE INVOLVES INTRACELLULAR SIGNALING MEDIATED BY PROTEINS INCLUDING THE ARYLHYDROCARBON RECEPTOR, AHR, WHOSE INTERACTION WITH THE 90 KILO DALTON HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN, HSP90, IS ESSENTIAL FOR MAINTAINING A HIGH AFFINITY LIGANDBINDING RECEPTOR CONFORMATION.|||[16968971]THIS IS POSSIBLY DUE TO SPT1 INTERACTING WITH HSP90 TO MODULATE AHR-HSP90 INTERACTION, AND ALTERING DOWNSTREAM EVENTS SUCH AS IN DOWNREGULATING THE TRANSACTIVATION AND METABOLIC ACTIVITY OF CYP1A1.|||[16968971]THIS IS SUPPORTED BY THE FACT THAT THE -75SPT1-GFP RECOMBINANT CELL LINE, WITH MUCH LOWER CAPACITY FOR CYP1A1 INDUCTION, EXHIBITED SUSTAINED MITOGENIC RESPONSE TO HIGH DOSES OF AHR LIGANDS, BUT NOT THE CYP1A1 INDUCIBLE WILD TYPE.|||[16968971]CONCEIVABLY, THE EFFECT MEDIATED BY SPT1 ON THE AHR SIGNALING PATHWAY IS AN IMPORTANT UNDERLYING FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO VARIABILITY IN CYP1A1 GENE EXPRESSION AND CONSEQUENTLY, CYTOTOXIC RESPONSE TO ENVIRONMENTALLY RELEVANT COMPOUNDS THAT POSE RISK TO HUMAN HEALTH.|||[16952353]AHR-TARGETED GENE SILENCING BY SMALL INTERFERING RNA DUPLEXES LED TO THE ABOLISHMENT OF NOT ONLY CYP1A1 BUT ALSO SLUG INDUCTION BY 3-METHYCHOLANTHRENE.|||[16903077]IN

NOT BIND THE RECEPTOR.|||[16891067]THE PRESENT STUDY INVESTIGATED THE POSSIBLE MECHANISMS OF OLTIPRAZ-INDUCED ACTIVATION OF AHR AND THE SUBSEQUENT INDUCTION OF CYP1A1 TRANSCRIPTION.|||[16891067]THIS INCREASE IN CALPAIN ACTIVITY WAS COUPLED WITH THE AHR ACTIVATION, AS EVIDENCED BY ITS NUCLEAR LOCALIZATION AND INCREASED TRANSCRIPTION OF CYP1A1 GENE.|||[16891067]TREATMENT OF CELLS WITH CALPAIN SPECIFIC INHIBITOR MDL 28170 COMPLETELY BLOCKED THE OLTIPRAZ-INDUCED NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATION OF AHR AND SUBSEQUENT CYP1A1 EXPRESSION.|||[16891067]THE PRESENTED DATA ESTABLISHED FOR THE FIRST TIME A MECHANISM OF ACTIVATING AHR AND ITS TRANSCRIPTION OF CYP1A1 BY OLTIPRAZ THROUGH ACTIVATION OF CALCIUM-DEPENDENT CALPAIN.|||[16877260]KNOWING THAT PAH-INDUCED TOXICITIES ARE MEDIATED BY THE ACTIVATION OF A CYTOSOLIC RECEPTOR, ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR), WHICH REGULATES THE EXPRESSION OF A GROUP OF XENOBIOTIC METABOLIZING ENZYMES (XMES) SUCH AS CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, NQO1, AND GSTA1, SUGGESTS A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN AHR-REGULATED XMES AND CVDS.|||[16876762]SECOND, MICE DEFICIENT IN AHR, CYP1A1 OR CYP1A2 WERE DOSED WITH NP ALONE, OR FOLLOWING PRETREATMENT WITH THE CYP2F INHIBITOR

TBHQ.|||[16581943]COTRANSFECTION OF HEPG2 CELLS WITH A DOMINANT NEGATIVE AHR NUCLEAR TRANSLOCATOR MUTANT ABOLISHED THE TBHQ-INDUCED CYP1A1 REPORTER ACTIVITY.|||[16581943]THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT CYP1A1 MAY BE INDUCED BY THE ANTIOXIDANT TBHQ VIA AN AHR-DEPENDENT MECHANISM.|||[16531450]SINCE THE TRANSCRIPTION OF CYP1A1 IS UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR), WE EXAMINED THE

CYP1A1-LUCIFERASE ACTIVITY WAS INDEPENDENT OF AHR ACTIVATION, AS DETERMINED BY ELECTROPHORETIC MOBILITY SHIFT ANALYSIS OF TCDD-ACTIVATED NUCLEAR AHR.|||[15899923]AHR ACTIVATED BY IL-4 CAUSED EXPRESSION OF A XENOBIOTIC-METABOLIZING GENE, CYP1A1, AND TCDD SYNERGISTICALLY ACTED ON THE INDUCTION OF THIS GENE BY IL-4.|||[15860575]ADDITIONAL EVENTS SUCH AS CYP1A1/1B1-DEPENDENT PAH METABOLISM AND ADDUCT FORMATION WERE ALSO REQUIRED SINCE 1) 2,3,7,8-TETRACHLORODIBENZO-P-DIOXIN, A VERY POTENT LIGAND OF THE AHR THAT IS POORLY METABOLIZED AND THEREFORE DOES NOT GENERATE REACTIVE METABOLITES IN CONTRAST TO PAHS, FAILED TO AFFECT CD34+ CELL EXPANSION; 2) THE CYP1A1/1B1 INHIBITOR ALPHA-NAPHTHOFLAVONE BLOCKED BOTH BP ADDUCT FORMATION AND BP TOXICITY; AND 3) BENZO(A)PYRENE-TRANS-7,8-DIHYDRODIOL-9,10-EPOXIDE, A HIGHLY REACTIVE BP METABOLITE, EXERTED A MARKED TOXICITY TOWARD CD34+ CELL CULTURES.|||[15843497]TOWARD THIS END, WE HAVE FOUND THAT PIFITHRIN-ALPHA IS A POTENT AHR AGONIST AS DETERMINED BY ITS ABILITY TO BIND THE AHR, INDUCE FORMATION OF ITS DNA BINDING COMPLEX, ACTIVATE REPORTER ACTIVITY, AND UP-REGULATE THE CLASSIC AHR TARGET GENE CYP1A1.|||[15837795]SEQUENTIAL TWO-STEP CHIP ASSAYS WERE PERFORMED WHICH DEMONSTRATE THAT AHR AND ER ALPHA ARE PRESENT TOGETHER AT THE SAME TIME ON THE CYP1A1 ENHANCER DURING

TRANSLOCATION OF THE AHR TO THE NUCLEUS WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO INDUCE CYP1A1 IN THE ABSENCE OF LIGAND, BUT REDUCTIONS IN THE LEVEL OF THE ENDOGENOUS AHR PROTEIN POOL SHIFTED THE DOSE-RESPONSE CURVE FOR TCDD TO THE RIGHT.|||[12237110]EXPOSURE TO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS SUCH AS POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS (PAHS) LEADS TO INDUCTION OF CYP1A1 VIA AHR PATHWAY.|||[12213569]MOST, IF NOT ALL, THE

THE TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVITY OF THE AHR.|||[11742002]IN TRANSIENT TRANSFECTION EXPERIMENTS USING A LUCIFERASE REPORTER GENE UNDER CONTROL OF AHR RESPONSE ELEMENTS, KILLIFISH AHRR INHIBITED THE TCDD-DEPENDENT TRANSACTIVATION FUNCTION OF BOTH AHR1 AND AHR2.|||[11597580]RESVERATROL DECREASES BASAL AND INDUCED CYP1A1 MRNA/PROTEIN LEVELS IN BOTH IN VITRO AND IN VIVO MODELS, AND SOME STUDIES SUGGEST THAT RESVERATROL ACTS AS AN ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR (AHR) ANTAGONIST.|||[11597580]IN CONTRAST, RESVERATROL DID NOT INHIBIT TCDD-INDUCED REPORTER GENE ACTIVITY IN CELLS TRANSFECTED WITH AN
